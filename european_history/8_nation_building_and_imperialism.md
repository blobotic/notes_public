# 62. Bonapartism: The Second French Empire, 1852-1870

## Political Institutions of the Second Empire

Napoleon III understood the importance of public opinion and that France (and Europe) were desperate for a single leader
- announced that he embodied tthe sovereignty of the people, like Napoleon I
- claimed that he had found a solution to the problem of democracy
	- parliamentary bodies accentuated class divisions
	- he would stand above classes and would govern equally in the interests of all
	- held that forms of government were less important than economic and social realities

political institutions hence authoritariant
- modeled on Consulate of Napoleon I
- Council of State 
	- experts drafted legislation and advised on technical matters
- appointed Senate
	- little significance
- Legislative Body
	- elected by universal male suffrage; elections were carefully managed (government put up an official candidate that all officeholders were required to support, in each district)
	- no independent power
		- could only consider legislation submitted to it by the emperor
		- no control over the budget, army, foreign office, or in making of war and peace
		- against the law to publish speeches made in the legislative chamber

Empress: Eugénie (died in 1920)
- sign of popularized royalty
- court life of the empire was the most brilliant and showy in Europe
- embellishment of Paris
	- Baron Haussmann, one of the most creative of city planners
		- roomy railway stations with broad approaches
		- system of boulevards and public squares
		- modernized sewers and the water supply
		- the building program stimulated business and employment

## Economic Developments under the Empire

Saint-Simonians
- called Napoleon III their "socialist emperor"
- invention of investment banking, hoping to guide economic growth through the concentration of financial resources
	- *Crédit Mobilier* - raised funds by selling its shares to the public
	- *Crédit Foncier* - a land bank established to lend funds to landowners for the improvement of agriculture

favorable period for expansion:
- discovery of gold in California in 1849 and later in Australia along with organized credit facilities substantially increased the European money supply
	- inflationary effect
- this encouraged company promotion and investment of capital
- railway mileage exploded
- shipping/naval: 
	- iron steamboats replaced wooden sailing ships
	- 1859 and 1869: built Suez Canal
- 1863: the law granted the right of "limited liability"- a stockholder could not lose more than the par value of the stock
	- encouraged investment by people of small means
	- stocks and shares became more numerous and diversified
	- the Stock Exchange boomed
	- many people became rich

working class
- land bank was useful to the wealthier peasants
- humanitarian relief
	- hospitals and asylums established
	- free medicine distributed
	- workers built unions
		- 1864: legal for organized workers to go on strike

believed in freedom of international trade
- project for a tariff union with Belgium, but it was blocked by private interests in both countries and opposed to by GB and the German *Zollverein*
- all-around reduction of import duties
- free trade treaty with GB in 1860
	- free traders in power in England since the repeal of the Corn Laws

## Internal Difficulties and War

troubles
- took a few years to overcome the depression of 1857
- free trade policies created enemies in industrialists
- Catholics objected to intervention in Italy

after 1860:
- emperor granted more leeway to the Legislative Body
- 1860s = decade of the Liberal Empire

by 1870, the emperor evaporated due to war


# 63. Backgrounds: The Idea of the Nation-State

before 1870, there were only two prominent nation-states: Great Britain and France

since 1860/1870, a nation-state system (the consolidation of large nations) has prevailed
- both brought people into larger units and broke them apart into smaller ones

A nation-state is one in which supreme political authority rests upon and represents the will and feeling of its inhabitants
- people need to feel a sense of belonging, that they are members of a community participating in a common life
- outsiders = "foreign"
- nation generally composed of those sharing the same speech
- may also possess a belief in common descent and a shared history or a common menace

They developed because in the 19th century governments couldn't effectively rule or develop the full powers of state without this sentiment

two distinct faces:
- union of preexisting smaller states
- creation of new ties between government and governed, admission of new segments of the population to political life through liberal/representative institutions

but they were realized only in a series of wars
- 1854: Crimean War
- 1859: Italian War
- 1864: Danish War
- 1866: Austro-Prussian War
- 1870: Franco-Prussian War
- before and after for 40 years there was no war between European powers

## The Crimean War, 1854-1856

primary significance: it seriously weakened both Austria and Russia
- who were most bent on preserving the peace settlement of 1815 and preventing national changes
- first war covered by newspaper correspondents
- first in which women established their position as army nurses
	- Florence Nightingale 

start of the war:
- began with yet another Russo-Turkish War:
	- 1853: Nicholas made demands on the large but decaying Ottoman Empire and moved on the two Danubian principalities, Wallachia and Moldavia (Romania)
- 1854: France joined the Turks
	- protection of Christians in the Ottoman Empire; French had long been the principal Western people in the Near East (money and advisers, trade, Christian missions, Suez Canal)
	- Napoleon III resented Tsar Nicholas, who regarded him as a revolutionary adventurer 
	- they had encouraged the Turkish government to resist Russian claims
- Great Britain also joined soon after
	- their settled policy was to uphold Turkey and the Near East against penetration by Russia

war:
- British fleet blockaded Russia in its Baltic and Black Sea outlets
- French and British armies invaded Russia, landing in the Crimean peninsula
- Austria, unwilling to see Russia conquer the Balkans and Constantinople or for EF to master the situation alone, occupied Wallachia and Moldavia, forcing Russia to evacuate

peace:
- Tsar Nicholas died in 1855; his successor ,Alexander II, sued for peace
- 1856 @ Paris: congress of all the great powers made peace
- pledged to jointly maintain the "integrity of the Ottoman Empire"
- Russia ceded territory and Moldavia, Wallachia (Romania), and Serbia recognized as self-governing principalities under the protection of the European powers
- Russia agreed to maintain no warships on the Black Sea and the Danube should be an international river open to commercial shipping of all nations

turbulence:
- Napoleon III needed glory
- Italians wanted unified Italy
- Prussians, who had done little, feared for their status as a great power
- only Austria and Russia, now weak, wanted to continue guarding the treaty of 1815

# 64. Cavour and the Italian War of 1859: The Unification of Italy

## Italian Nationalism: The Program of Cavour

Italy contained about a dozen sizable states and a few very small ones; later reorganized by Napoleon then by the Congress of Vienna
- Sardinia (Piedmont)
- Lombardy & Venetia (belonged to Austria)
- Tuscany (capital at Florence)
- Modena, Parma, and Luca in between Tuscany and other states
- papal states (hereditary possession of the Roman See)
- Naples/Two Sicilies (ruled by a branch of the bourbons)

widespread disgust in Italy with existing authorities and growing desire for a liberal national state
- resurrect the Italian grandeur of ancient times and of the Renaissance
- dream of an Italian Risorgimento (resurgence) - had exploded in the writings of Mazzini and in the events of 1848

Camillo di Cavour, prime minister of Piedmont under King Victor Emmanuel
- liberal, tried to make Piedmont a model of progress, efficiency, and fair government that other Italians would admire
- planted constitutional and parliamentary practices in Piedmont
- built railroads and docks, improved agriculture, emancipated trade
- anticlerical policy
	- cutting down on religious holidays
	- limited right of church bodies to own real estate
	- abolished church courts
- no sympathy for the revolutionary and republican nationalism of Mazzini
- embraced the toughness of mind and the "politics of reality"
	- didn't approve of republicans but was willing to work with them
	- didn't idealize war but was willing to make war
		- had joined the Crimean War in hopes of joining the Congress of Paris

April 1859: Cavour tricked Austria into a declaration of war
- Italy with France's assistance (Napoleon willing because he believed that fighting reactionary Austria would mollify liberal  opinions in France and in 1858, an Italian republican named Orsini tried to assassinate him)
- France/Piedmont won the two battles of Magenta and Solferino
- Napoleon's second thoughts
	- Prussia began mobilizing on the Rhine, unwilling to see the France create an Italian sphere of influence
	- revolutionary agitation broke out in Italy, to Napoleon's discontent
- July 1859: Napoleon III made a separate peace with Austria
	- gave Lombardy to Piedmont; Austria retained Venetia
	- offered a federal union of existing Italian governments overseen by the pope
- revolution spread, undeterred even when the pope excommunicated them, and they annexed multiple states to Piedmont
	- 1860 at Turin: first parliament of the kingdom of Italy
	- GB delighted
	- Napoleon III recognized the expanded Piedmontese state in return for gaining Nice and Savoy

## The Completion of Italian Unity

Giuseppe Garibaldi
- organized a group of 1150, "Garibaldi's Thousand"/"Red Shirts"
- led them to invade the Two Sicilies, which were being undermined by revolutionary agitation
- wanted to continue pushing up from Naples to Rome, but Cavour was unwilling to be that extreme and sent a Piedmontese army into the papal states, avoiding Rome
- Gariboldi accepted a monarchy as the best solution and rode in an open carriage with Victor Emmanuel

1861: parliament representing all Italy except for Rome and Venetia met in 1861, and the Kingdom of Italy was formally proclaimed with Victor Emmanuel II as king
- Venetia added in 1866 as a prize for Italian aid to Prussia in a war against Austria
- Rome annexed in 1870 after the Franco-Prussian War of 1870 and the withdrawal of French troops

## Persistent Problems after Unification

little was settled by unification
- nationalists believed that Italian unity would only be completed when further Italian-speaking regions of Italy were incorporated
	- *Italia irredenta* - "irredentism," vociferous demand on nationalist grounds for annexation of regions beyond one's own frontiers
- rift between church and state
	- pope vowed to reside in seclusion in the Vatican
- northern vs southern, agrarian Italy
- new Italy was parliamentary but not democratic
	- vote initially given to 600k/20mil people
	- parliamentary life was unrealistic and corrupt
- revolutionary agitation continued
	- Garibaldi even made two more attempts to seize Rome by force
- successful Risorgimento

# 65. Bismarck: The Founding of a German Empire

## The German States after 1848

at the Frankfurt assembly, a group of private citizens attempted to organize a united Germany by constitutional methods, but they failed because they had no power and weren't sufficiently revolutionary

after 1848: extreme admiration for *die Macht*
- by 1850 the old states were restored, including the loose confederation of 1815, but the output of both coal and iron in Germany between 1850 and 1870 multiplied 6x 
- *Zollverein* formed by Prussia in 1834 included almost all Germany outside of Austria and Bohemia, provided economic unity
- German cities growing and bound by railroads and telegraphs
- industrial capitalists and industrial workers becoming more numerous

## Prussia in the 1860s: Bismarck

Prussia rose after being ruined by Napoleon
- after 1850, Prussia had a parliament
- despite population going from 11 to 18 million, the army remained the same size because the parliament refused to increase sufficient financial appropriations

Otto van Bismarck, appointed chief minister by the king in 1862
- Junker and intelligent (felt an impatient contempt for the slow-witted landlord class he came from)
	- advocated a stout Protestant piety 
	- undeterred by criticism and denunciation, although he cared for them
- not a nationalist; he cared only for Prussia 
	- the West, including the bulk of Germany, seemed revolutionary, turbulent, free-thinking, and materialistic, unable to be trusted
- considered parliamentary bodies ignorant and irresponsible
- detested liberalism, democracy, and socialism
- **classic practitioner of *Realpolitik***
- 1862-1866: "constitutional struggle"
	- parliament refused to vote the proposed taxes, government collected them regardless, taxpayers paid without protest bnecause collectors represented public authority
	- military policy > theory of government by consent
	- due to limitations of Prussian liberalism, docility of population, respect for officialdom, belief that king and ministers were wiser than the elected deputies
	- army thus enlarged, reorganized, retrained, and reequipped 
	- parliament declared government's policy unconstitutional
	- Bismarck declared that the constitution could not have meant to undermine the state
	- "Not by speeches and majority votes are the great questions of the day decided—that was the great error of 1848 and 1849—but by blood and iron."

## Bismarck's Wars: The North German Confederation, 1867

Danes wanted to incorporate Schleswig into Denmark
- diet of the German confederation, unwilling to see Germans annexed outright to Denmark, called for an all-German war on the Danes like the Frankfurt Assembly
- Bismarck wanted a Prussian war rather than an all-German war
	- had to disguise his aims with Austria

1864: Prussia and Austria went to war with Denmark and soon defeated it
- Bismarck arranged a provisional occupation of Schleswig by Prussia and of Holstein by Austria
- as disputes arose over rights of passage, he then discredited and isolated Prussia
	- British government engaging in nonintervention
	- Russia divided internally by a reform program and was hostile to Austria because of the Crimean War
	- tempted Italy with Venetia
	- France (Napoleon III) was embarrassed by domestic discontents and his army was committed to Mexico
	- presented himself as a democrat to weaken Austria within Germany by proposing a reform of the German confederation
		- planned to use "democracy" to undermine all established interests that stood in his way

Austro-Prussian (Seven Weeks') War
- Austria raised the matter of Schleswig-Holstein in the German federal diet
- Bismarck declared the diet to have no authority and accused Austria of aggression, sending the Prussian army into Holstein
- Austria called for all-German force to be sent against Prussia
- Prussia vs. most of the other German states
	- Prussian army proved its superiority (with the new needle-gun, novel combat strategy with the new railroads)
- Prussia annexed Schleswig-Holstein, the kingdom of Hanover, the duchies of Nassau and Hesse-Cassel, and the free city of Frankfurt
- Bismarck organized a North German Confederation in place of the German federal union
	-  new constitution much stronger than the Confederation of 1815
	- king of Prussia became hereditary head
	- parliament of two chambers (upper = state, lower = universal suffrage)
		- universal suffrage considered reactionary; Bismarck used it to negotiate with German socialists to win popular support

## The Franco-Prussian War

Bismarck believed that a war between France and Prussia would frighten the small south German states into union with Prussia, leaving only Austria outside

Napoleon believed that a successful war would restore public approval of the Bonapartist empire

in Spain: a Spanish provisional government invited Prince Leopold of Hohenzollern, the king of Prussia's cousin, who refused thrice but accepted after Bismarck persuaded Spain to extend the offer a fourth time
- July 2, 1870: French ambassador to Prussia demanded that Prince Leopold's acceptance be withdrawn 
- July 12, 1870: Leopold's acceptance was withdrawn
- Bismarck disappointed

"Ems dispatch" - French government demanded that at no time in the future would any Hohenzollern ever become a candidate for the Spanish throne
- king of Ems telegraphed a full report of the conversation to Bismarck
- Bismarck abridged and edited it to maximize the offense to both the Prussians and French

July 19, 1870: Napoleon III declared war on Prussia
- Bismarck took care to isolate France beforehand
	- British felt France to be in the wrong
	- Italians wanted Rome
	- Russia wanted to keep naval vessels in the Black Sea, breaking the Peace of 1856, which they did in 1870
- south German states supported Prussia
- September 2, after the battle of Sedan: the French army surrendered to the Germans and Napoleon III was taken prisoner
- September 4: an insurrection in Paris proclaimed the Third Republic

## The German Empire, 1871

January 18, 1871: in the château and gardens of Versailles, Bismarck proclaimed the German Empire and received the hereditary title of German emperor
- other German rulers except Austria accepted his imperial authority

France:
- ten days later, Paris opened their gates to Germany
- no government to make peace with
	- Bismarck insisted on the election of a Constituent Assembly by universal suffrage
	- demanded France pay the German Empire a war indemnity of five billion gold francs, and cede the Alsace and most of Lorraine
	- outrage from France
- May 10, 1871: treaty of Frankfurt, contained terms Bismarck dictated

the consolidation of Germany reversed both the Peace of Vienna as well as the Peace of Westphalia
- German Empire instantly became the strongest state on the continent of Europe, and even more after rapid industrialization after 1870
- "indemnity act" - Bismarck admitted to a certain high-handedness during the constitutional struggle but that parliament legalized disputed tax collections *ex post facto* in view of victory over Austria and its consequences
	- liberalism withered away before nationalism
- federation of monarchies that rested on mass appeal (Reichstag elected by universal male suffrage), although the ministers were responsible to the emperor and not the elected chamber
	- popular approval
- German Empire served to magnify the roel of Prussia, the Prussian army, and the East-Elbian Prussian aristocracy in world affairs
