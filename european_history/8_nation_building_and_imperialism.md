# 62. Bonapartism: The Second French Empire, 1852-1870

## Political Institutions of the Second Empire

Napoleon III understood the importance of public opinion and that France (and Europe) were desperate for a single leader
- announced that he embodied tthe sovereignty of the people, like Napoleon I
- claimed that he had found a solution to the problem of democracy
	- parliamentary bodies accentuated class divisions
	- he would stand above classes and would govern equally in the interests of all
	- held that forms of government were less important than economic and social realities

political institutions hence authoritarian
- modeled on Consulate of Napoleon I
- Council of State 
	- experts drafted legislation and advised on technical matters
- appointed Senate
	- little significance
- Legislative Body
	- elected by universal male suffrage; elections were carefully managed (government put up an official candidate that all officeholders were required to support, in each district)
	- no independent power
		- could only consider legislation submitted to it by the emperor
		- no control over the budget, army, foreign office, or in making of war and peace
		- against the law to publish speeches made in the legislative chamber

Empress: Eugénie (died in 1920)
- sign of popularized royalty
- court life of the empire was the most brilliant and showy in Europe
- embellishment of Paris
	- Baron Haussmann, one of the most creative of city planners
		- roomy railway stations with broad approaches
		- system of boulevards and public squares
		- modernized sewers and the water supply
		- the building program stimulated business and employment

## Economic Developments under the Empire

Saint-Simonians
- called Napoleon III their "socialist emperor"
- invention of investment banking, hoping to guide economic growth through the concentration of financial resources
	- *Crédit Mobilier* - raised funds by selling its shares to the public
	- *Crédit Foncier* - a land bank established to lend funds to landowners for the improvement of agriculture

favorable period for expansion:
- discovery of gold in California in 1849 and later in Australia along with organized credit facilities substantially increased the European money supply
	- inflationary effect
- this encouraged company promotion and investment of capital
- railway mileage exploded
- shipping/naval: 
	- iron steamboats replaced wooden sailing ships
	- 1859 and 1869: built Suez Canal
- 1863: the law granted the right of "limited liability"- a stockholder could not lose more than the par value of the stock
	- encouraged investment by people of small means
	- stocks and shares became more numerous and diversified
	- the Stock Exchange boomed
	- many people became rich

working class
- land bank was useful to the wealthier peasants
- humanitarian relief
	- hospitals and asylums established
	- free medicine distributed
	- workers built unions
		- 1864: legal for organized workers to go on strike

believed in freedom of international trade
- project for a tariff union with Belgium, but it was blocked by private interests in both countries and opposed to by GB and the German *Zollverein*
- all-around reduction of import duties
- free trade treaty with GB in 1860
	- free traders in power in England since the repeal of the Corn Laws

## Internal Difficulties and War

troubles
- took a few years to overcome the depression of 1857
- free trade policies created enemies in industrialists
- Catholics objected to intervention in Italy

after 1860:
- emperor granted more leeway to the Legislative Body
- 1860s = decade of the Liberal Empire

by 1870, the emperor evaporated due to war


# 63. Backgrounds: The Idea of the Nation-State

before 1870, there were only two prominent nation-states: Great Britain and France

since 1860/1870, a nation-state system (the consolidation of large nations) has prevailed
- both brought people into larger units and broke them apart into smaller ones

A nation-state is one in which supreme political authority rests upon and represents the will and feeling of its inhabitants
- people need to feel a sense of belonging, that they are members of a community participating in a common life
- outsiders = "foreign"
- nation generally composed of those sharing the same speech
- may also possess a belief in common descent and a shared history or a common menace

They developed because in the 19th century governments couldn't effectively rule or develop the full powers of state without this sentiment

two distinct faces:
- union of preexisting smaller states
- creation of new ties between government and governed, admission of new segments of the population to political life through liberal/representative institutions

but they were realized only in a series of wars
- 1854: Crimean War
- 1859: Italian War
- 1864: Danish War
- 1866: Austro-Prussian War
- 1870: Franco-Prussian War
- before and after for 40 years there was no war between European powers

## The Crimean War, 1854-1856

primary significance: it seriously weakened both Austria and Russia
- who were most bent on preserving the peace settlement of 1815 and preventing national changes
- first war covered by newspaper correspondents
- first in which women established their position as army nurses
	- Florence Nightingale 

start of the war:
- began with yet another Russo-Turkish War:
	- 1853: Nicholas made demands on the large but decaying Ottoman Empire and moved on the two Danubian principalities, Wallachia and Moldavia (Romania)
- 1854: France joined the Turks
	- protection of Christians in the Ottoman Empire; French had long been the principal Western people in the Near East (money and advisers, trade, Christian missions, Suez Canal)
	- Napoleon III resented Tsar Nicholas, who regarded him as a revolutionary adventurer 
	- they had encouraged the Turkish government to resist Russian claims
- Great Britain also joined soon after
	- their settled policy was to uphold Turkey and the Near East against penetration by Russia

war:
- British fleet blockaded Russia in its Baltic and Black Sea outlets
- French and British armies invaded Russia, landing in the Crimean peninsula
- Austria, unwilling to see Russia conquer the Balkans and Constantinople or for EF to master the situation alone, occupied Wallachia and Moldavia, forcing Russia to evacuate

peace:
- Tsar Nicholas died in 1855; his successor ,Alexander II, sued for peace
- 1856 @ Paris: congress of all the great powers made peace
- pledged to jointly maintain the "integrity of the Ottoman Empire"
- Russia ceded territory and Moldavia, Wallachia (Romania), and Serbia recognized as self-governing principalities under the protection of the European powers
- Russia agreed to maintain no warships on the Black Sea and the Danube should be an international river open to commercial shipping of all nations

turbulence:
- Napoleon III needed glory
- Italians wanted unified Italy
- Prussians, who had done little, feared for their status as a great power
- only Austria and Russia, now weak, wanted to continue guarding the treaty of 1815

# 64. Cavour and the Italian War of 1859: The Unification of Italy

## Italian Nationalism: The Program of Cavour

Italy contained about a dozen sizable states and a few very small ones; later reorganized by Napoleon then by the Congress of Vienna
- Sardinia (Piedmont)
- Lombardy & Venetia (belonged to Austria)
- Tuscany (capital at Florence)
- Modena, Parma, and Luca in between Tuscany and other states
- papal states (hereditary possession of the Roman See)
- Naples/Two Sicilies (ruled by a branch of the bourbons)

widespread disgust in Italy with existing authorities and growing desire for a liberal national state
- resurrect the Italian grandeur of ancient times and of the Renaissance
- dream of an Italian Risorgimento (resurgence) - had exploded in the writings of Mazzini and in the events of 1848

Camillo di Cavour, prime minister of Piedmont under King Victor Emmanuel
- liberal, tried to make Piedmont a model of progress, efficiency, and fair government that other Italians would admire
- planted constitutional and parliamentary practices in Piedmont
- built railroads and docks, improved agriculture, emancipated trade
- anticlerical policy
	- cutting down on religious holidays
	- limited right of church bodies to own real estate
	- abolished church courts
- no sympathy for the revolutionary and republican nationalism of Mazzini
- embraced the toughness of mind and the "politics of reality"
	- didn't approve of republicans but was willing to work with them
	- didn't idealize war but was willing to make war
		- had joined the Crimean War in hopes of joining the Congress of Paris

April 1859: Cavour tricked Austria into a declaration of war
- Italy with France's assistance (Napoleon willing because he believed that fighting reactionary Austria would mollify liberal  opinions in France and in 1858, an Italian republican named Orsini tried to assassinate him)
- France/Piedmont won the two battles of Magenta and Solferino
- Napoleon's second thoughts
	- Prussia began mobilizing on the Rhine, unwilling to see the France create an Italian sphere of influence
	- revolutionary agitation broke out in Italy, to Napoleon's discontent
- July 1859: Napoleon III made a separate peace with Austria
	- gave Lombardy to Piedmont; Austria retained Venetia
	- offered a federal union of existing Italian governments overseen by the pope
- revolution spread, undeterred even when the pope excommunicated them, and they annexed multiple states to Piedmont
	- 1860 at Turin: first parliament of the kingdom of Italy
	- GB delighted
	- Napoleon III recognized the expanded Piedmontese state in return for gaining Nice and Savoy

## The Completion of Italian Unity

Giuseppe Garibaldi
- organized a group of 1150, "Garibaldi's Thousand"/"Red Shirts"
- led them to invade the Two Sicilies, which were being undermined by revolutionary agitation
- wanted to continue pushing up from Naples to Rome, but Cavour was unwilling to be that extreme and sent a Piedmontese army into the papal states, avoiding Rome
- Gariboldi accepted a monarchy as the best solution and rode in an open carriage with Victor Emmanuel

1861: parliament representing all Italy except for Rome and Venetia met in 1861, and the Kingdom of Italy was formally proclaimed with Victor Emmanuel II as king
- Venetia added in 1866 as a prize for Italian aid to Prussia in a war against Austria
- Rome annexed in 1870 after the Franco-Prussian War of 1870 and the withdrawal of French troops

## Persistent Problems after Unification

little was settled by unification
- nationalists believed that Italian unity would only be completed when further Italian-speaking regions of Italy were incorporated
	- *Italia irredenta* - "irredentism," vociferous demand on nationalist grounds for annexation of regions beyond one's own frontiers
- rift between church and state
	- pope vowed to reside in seclusion in the Vatican
- northern vs southern, agrarian Italy
- new Italy was parliamentary but not democratic
	- vote initially given to 600k/20mil people
	- parliamentary life was unrealistic and corrupt
- revolutionary agitation continued
	- Garibaldi even made two more attempts to seize Rome by force
- successful Risorgimento

# 65. Bismarck: The Founding of a German Empire

## The German States after 1848

at the Frankfurt assembly, a group of private citizens attempted to organize a united Germany by constitutional methods, but they failed because they had no power and weren't sufficiently revolutionary

after 1848: extreme admiration for *die Macht*
- by 1850 the old states were restored, including the loose confederation of 1815, but the output of both coal and iron in Germany between 1850 and 1870 multiplied 6x 
- *Zollverein* formed by Prussia in 1834 included almost all Germany outside of Austria and Bohemia, provided economic unity
- German cities growing and bound by railroads and telegraphs
- industrial capitalists and industrial workers becoming more numerous

## Prussia in the 1860s: Bismarck

Prussia rose after being ruined by Napoleon
- after 1850, Prussia had a parliament
- despite population going from 11 to 18 million, the army remained the same size because the parliament refused to increase sufficient financial appropriations

Otto van Bismarck, appointed chief minister by the king in 1862
- Junker and intelligent (felt an impatient contempt for the slow-witted landlord class he came from)
	- advocated a stout Protestant piety 
	- undeterred by criticism and denunciation, although he cared for them
- not a nationalist; he cared only for Prussia 
	- the West, including the bulk of Germany, seemed revolutionary, turbulent, free-thinking, and materialistic, unable to be trusted
- considered parliamentary bodies ignorant and irresponsible
- detested liberalism, democracy, and socialism
- **classic practitioner of *Realpolitik***
- 1862-1866: "constitutional struggle"
	- parliament refused to vote the proposed taxes, government collected them regardless, taxpayers paid without protest bnecause collectors represented public authority
	- military policy > theory of government by consent
	- due to limitations of Prussian liberalism, docility of population, respect for officialdom, belief that king and ministers were wiser than the elected deputies
	- army thus enlarged, reorganized, retrained, and reequipped 
	- parliament declared government's policy unconstitutional
	- Bismarck declared that the constitution could not have meant to undermine the state
	- "Not by speeches and majority votes are the great questions of the day decided—that was the great error of 1848 and 1849—but by blood and iron."

## Bismarck's Wars: The North German Confederation, 1867

Danes wanted to incorporate Schleswig into Denmark
- diet of the German confederation, unwilling to see Germans annexed outright to Denmark, called for an all-German war on the Danes like the Frankfurt Assembly
- Bismarck wanted a Prussian war rather than an all-German war
	- had to disguise his aims with Austria

1864: Prussia and Austria went to war with Denmark and soon defeated it
- Bismarck arranged a provisional occupation of Schleswig by Prussia and of Holstein by Austria
- as disputes arose over rights of passage, he then discredited and isolated Prussia
	- British government engaging in nonintervention
	- Russia divided internally by a reform program and was hostile to Austria because of the Crimean War
	- tempted Italy with Venetia
	- France (Napoleon III) was embarrassed by domestic discontents and his army was committed to Mexico
	- presented himself as a democrat to weaken Austria within Germany by proposing a reform of the German confederation
		- planned to use "democracy" to undermine all established interests that stood in his way

Austro-Prussian (Seven Weeks') War
- Austria raised the matter of Schleswig-Holstein in the German federal diet
- Bismarck declared the diet to have no authority and accused Austria of aggression, sending the Prussian army into Holstein
- Austria called for all-German force to be sent against Prussia
- Prussia vs. most of the other German states
	- Prussian army proved its superiority (with the new needle-gun, novel combat strategy with the new railroads)
- Prussia annexed Schleswig-Holstein, the kingdom of Hanover, the duchies of Nassau and Hesse-Cassel, and the free city of Frankfurt
- Bismarck organized a North German Confederation in place of the German federal union
	-  new constitution much stronger than the Confederation of 1815
	- king of Prussia became hereditary head
	- parliament of two chambers (upper = state, lower = universal suffrage)
		- universal suffrage considered reactionary; Bismarck used it to negotiate with German socialists to win popular support

## The Franco-Prussian War

Bismarck believed that a war between France and Prussia would frighten the small south German states into union with Prussia, leaving only Austria outside

Napoleon believed that a successful war would restore public approval of the Bonapartist empire

in Spain: a Spanish provisional government invited Prince Leopold of Hohenzollern, the king of Prussia's cousin, who refused thrice but accepted after Bismarck persuaded Spain to extend the offer a fourth time
- July 2, 1870: French ambassador to Prussia demanded that Prince Leopold's acceptance be withdrawn 
- July 12, 1870: Leopold's acceptance was withdrawn
- Bismarck disappointed

"Ems dispatch" - French government demanded that at no time in the future would any Hohenzollern ever become a candidate for the Spanish throne
- king of Ems telegraphed a full report of the conversation to Bismarck
- Bismarck abridged and edited it to maximize the offense to both the Prussians and French

July 19, 1870: Napoleon III declared war on Prussia
- Bismarck took care to isolate France beforehand
	- British felt France to be in the wrong
	- Italians wanted Rome
	- Russia wanted to keep naval vessels in the Black Sea, breaking the Peace of 1856, which they did in 1870
- south German states supported Prussia
- September 2, after the battle of Sedan: the French army surrendered to the Germans and Napoleon III was taken prisoner
- September 4: an insurrection in Paris proclaimed the Third Republic

## The German Empire, 1871

January 18, 1871: in the château and gardens of Versailles, Bismarck proclaimed the German Empire and received the hereditary title of German emperor
- other German rulers except Austria accepted his imperial authority

France:
- ten days later, Paris opened their gates to Germany
- no government to make peace with
	- Bismarck insisted on the election of a Constituent Assembly by universal suffrage
	- demanded France pay the German Empire a war indemnity of five billion gold francs, and cede the Alsace and most of Lorraine
	- outrage from France
- May 10, 1871: treaty of Frankfurt, contained terms Bismarck dictated

the consolidation of Germany reversed both the Peace of Vienna as well as the Peace of Westphalia
- German Empire instantly became the strongest state on the continent of Europe, and even more after rapid industrialization after 1870
- "indemnity act" - Bismarck admitted to a certain high-handedness during the constitutional struggle but that parliament legalized disputed tax collections *ex post facto* in view of victory over Austria and its consequences
	- liberalism withered away before nationalism
- federation of monarchies that rested on mass appeal (Reichstag elected by universal male suffrage), although the ministers were responsible to the emperor and not the elected chamber
	- popular approval
- German Empire served to magnify the roel of Prussia, the Prussian army, and the East-Elbian Prussian aristocracy in world affairs



# 66. The Dual Monarchy of Austria-Hungary

## The Habsburg Empire after 1848

Essential question: how would the Habsburg government react tot the problems raised by national self-expression?
- only extreme radicals dreamed of independent Hungary; most didn't wish to destroy the empire
- instead, desired constitutional autonomy fir Hungary while maintaining the link with Austria
	- Slav opinion = Austroslavism
	- people thought the empire's underlying political structure necessary

Francis Joseph (reigned 1848-1916)
- disliked everything liberal, progressive, or modern
- allied with the Catholic hierarchy and the Vatican
- utterly incapable of enlarged views, arduous ambitious projects, bold decisions, or persevering action
- government tried and failed at various expedients
	- for several years, the ruling idea was centralization (ruling empire through German language and German efficiency), which the Mgayars hated

## The Compromise of 1867

1867: the *Ausgleich*, a bargain between the Germans of Austria-Bohemia and the Magyars of Hungary
- worked to the common disadvantage of Slavs because both Germans and Magyars looked upon them as uncouth and uncivilized, barbarians
- idea: each people (Germans and Magyars) should govern its own barbarians in its own way
- created a Dual Monarchy (Empire of Austria and the Kingdom of Hungary, now judged equal)
	- each had its own constitution and parliament
	- administrative language of Austria: German, of Hungary: Magyar
	- neither state would interfere in the other's affairs
	- union: 
		- same Habsburg ruler should be emperor in Austria and king in Hungary
		- two parliaments were to meet together alternately in Vienna and Budapest
		- common ministry for finance, foreign affairs, and war
- treated Austria as a German nation-state and Hungary as a Magyar nation-state
- problem: Germans and Magyars were not the majority of the population in either nation-state

owners of the great landed estates remained the unquestionably dominant class
- landless peasants
- agrarian proletariat

nationality and social questions came together; landlordism became the basic social issue

# 67. Liberalization in Tsarist Russia: Alexander II

## Tsarist Russia after 1856

Russia's differences:
- leading institution was the autocracy of the tsar, different from the absolutism of the West
- some ideas didn't exist/were imported from Europe:
	- spiritual authority independent of even the mightiest prince
	- reciprocal duties between king and subject
- tsardom ruled by police action and the army, not by law

as Russia came into more contact with Europe, Russians began to acquire European ideas that the autocracy disliked—fraternity, liberty, of a just and classless society, etc

press and universities were severely censored

second fundamental institution: serfdom
- bulk of the population were serfs dependent on masters
- by the mid 19th century, both conservative and liberal Russians agreed that serfdom must some day end
	- ceased to be profitable
	- 2/3 of all privately owned serfs were mortgaged as security for loans at the time of Alexander II's accession
	- serfdom recognized as a bad system
		- made muzhiks into illiterate and stolid dredges, without incentive, initiative, self-respect, or pride of workmanship
		- poor soldiers for the army

educated Russians, full of Western ideas, were estranged from the government, the Orthodox church, and the common people of their country
- "intelligentsia" - exciting to be educated, to have ideas, etc
- made up of students, university graduates, and people with enough leisure to read
- believed intellectuals should play a large role in society
- heavy opposition: turning to revolutionary and even terroristic philosophies
- made bureaucrats more anxious and fearful, and the government more repressive

## The Emancipation Act of 1861 and Other Reforms

Alexander II attempted to enlist the support of the liberals among the intelligentsia
- gave permission to travel outside of Russia
- eased controls on universities
- allowed censorship to go relatively unenforced
- newspapers and journals founded

outburst on public opinion that agreed on the necessity of emancipating the peasants
- NOT a class question; his father, Nicholas I, despite abhorring liberalism, had taken measures to alleviate serfdom
- Alexander II set up a special branch of the government to study the question
- imperial ukase of 1861: declared serfdom abolished and the peasants free
	- allocated half of cultivated land to gentry and other half to serfs
- people hoped the peasants would be stirred by a new sense of human dignity
- strengthened aristocrats because much property was about to be mortgaged anyway, and they received redemption money and were free of obligations to peasants
- peasants land, when redeemed, became the collective property of the ancient peasant village assembly *mir* -> peasants became restricted in villages as they had once been restricted by their lords

Alexander II overhauled and westernized the legal system of the country
- edit of 1864:
	- trials public
	- private persons have the right to be represented in court by lawyers of their own choosing
	- all class distinctions in judicial matters were abolished (although in practice peasants continued to be subject to harsh disadvantages)
	- clear sequence of lower and higher courts established
	- requirements for professional training of judges
	- system of juries introduced

hoping to win liberals and to shoulder the upper and middle classes with some degree of public responsibility, Alexander also moved toward allowing self-government
- edit of 1864L 
	- created system of elected provincial and district councils (zemstvos)
		- managed education, medical relief, public welfare, food supply, and road maintenance in their localities
		- developed civic sentiment among those who took part in them
- liberals urged a representative body; Alexander II refused
- Poland rebellion in 1863 inclined him to favor repression more

## Revolutionism in Russia

revolutionaries dissatisfied with the reforms, which if successful would merely strengthen the existing order
- "nihilists"; believed in nothing except science and took a cynical view of the reforming tsar and his zemstvos
- peasants remained unsatisfied (heavy redemption payments)
- intellectuals fanned this discontent

socialists came to believe that the natural future of socialism lay in Russia because of the weakness of capitalism and the existence of a kind of collectivism already established in village assemblies or communes

anarchist Bakunin and his disciple Nechaiev
- *People's Justice* - called for terrorism against tsarist officials and liberals
- *Catachism of a Revolutionist*
- but terrorism was largely rejected by many revolutionaries
- some groups organized secret terroristic societies, like the People's Will

alarmed, and to rally support from the liberals, in 1880, he relaxed the autocratic system again
- abolished the Third Section (secret police) set up by his father
- allowed press to discuss most political subjects freely
- encouraged the zemstvos to do the same
- proposed two nationally elected commissions to sit with the council of state 
	- signed this edict on March 13, 1881 and was at the same date assassinated by the members of the People's Will

# 75. The Advance of Democracy: Socialism and Labor Unions

artisan and laboring classes never viewed capitalism or "bourgeois" liberalism favorably

to improve their position, they resorted to two principal lines of action:
1. abolish the capitalists (socialism)
2. bargain with them (formation of labor unions so that the workers had reason to keep their employers prosperously in business in order that bargaining with them might produce more results)
- internal contradiction in the working-class movement
	- the middle-class and educated "intellectuals" of the movement tended more to socialism because they thought of society as a whole and saw the economic system as a system
	- actual workers tended to unions and looked on the intellectual as an outsider

## The Trade Union Movement and Rise of British Labor

rise rise of "bourgeois" liberalism first gave legal freedom to labor unions despite being insensitive to the worker in most ways
- prosperity of the 1850s favored the formation of unions because workers organize most easily when employers are most in need of their services

craft union: most successful of "new model" unionism introduced in England by the Amalgamated Society of Engineers in 1851
- took unions out of politics
- concentrate on advancing the interests of each separate trade
- be reasonable with employers, avoid strikes, accumulate union funds, and build up membership
- successful

industrial unionism (joining in one union of all workers in one industry) began to take shape in the 1880s
- due to their advances in trade unionism, they were much slower than their Continental counterparts in forming a workers'political party, and when it came into existence, it was less socialistic
- Taff Vale decision: held a union ifinancially responsible for business losses incurred by an employer during a strike
	- threatened unions, unifying them and precipitated the formation of the modern Labour party
	- election of 1906: new Labour party sent 29 members to Parliament and overruled the Taff Vale decision by new legislation

## European Socialism after 1850

1864: first meeting of the International Working Men's Association in London, aka the First International
- amongst the sponsors included the secretary of the British carpenters' union, Robert Applegarth, the aging Italian revolutionary, Mazzini, and KArl Marx
- leadership gradually passed to MArx as union officials became absorbed in union business
- Marx abhorred anarchism because he thought that the target of action should be not the state but the capitalist economic system; the government was merely a tool
- he ostracized others and drove them out from the International

Paris Commune of 1871
- members of the First International watched it with great excitement
- after Marx praised it as a stage in the international class war, he scared possible followers away and the First International disappeared by 1872

after 1875, several socialist parties formed in Germany, Belgium, France, and Russia

1889: socialist parties came together to establish the Second International, which thereafter met every three years and lasted until 1914

## Revisionist and Revolutionary Socialism, 1880-1914

new socialist parties of the 1880s were all MArxist in inspiration; Marx died in 1883 - "scientific socialism"
- strongest in Germany and France
- unsuccessful in Italy and Spain, where the working class, less industrialized and illiterate, turned more to anarchism
- unsuccessful in England because they believed that socialism was the social and economic counterpart to political democracy and its eventual outcome
	- no class conflict necessary or existed
	- Fabians

Marxist/Social Democratic parties grew rapidly
- Marxism turned into a less revolutionary "parliamentry socialism" exceppt for the Russian Social Democratic Party
- increased importance of union officials because true workers and not just intellectuals were voting for socialist candidates, so they worked mainly for their own individual benefits in their own country rather than internationally
- Marx's anticipations still hadn't come true: bourgeois was getting richer but the proletarian was not getting poorer

in vain, the Second International warned its component socialist parties against collaboration with the bourgeoisie

1890s: Marxism began to undergo a movement of revisionism, led by JEan JAurès in France and by Eduard Bernstein in Germany
- class conflict might not be absolutely inevitable, capitalism might be gradually gtransformed in the workers' interest
- with the right to vote, workers could obtain their ends through democratic channels
- most socialists/social democrats followed the revisionists

tendency to "opportunism" drove the truly revolutionary spirits into new directions
- revolutionary syndicalism, from *syndicat* - union
	- idea that the workers' unions might themselves become supreme authoritative institutions in society, replacing property, the market economy, and government itself
	- means to this end was a stupendous general strike to paralyze society into forcing it to accept their will
	- most headway where unions were the wakest because the unions had the least to lose and needed sensational doctrines to attract members the most
- revival of Marxist fundamentals in protest against revisionism
	- condemned socialists who had entered the government (unpardonably identifying themselves with the enemy bourgeois state)

in general, by the turn of the century, most people who called themselves Marxists were no logner actively revolutionary

social agitation from 1848 had subsided, three principal reasons:
1. capitalism had worked well enough to raise the workers' living standard above what they could remember of their fathers' and grandfathers' 
2. workers had the vote and could participate in the state, thus could expect to benefit from the government and had little to gain by its overthrow
3. they had their interests watched over by organized and increasingly powerful unions so that they could demand a larger share in the national income


# 78. Imperialism: Its Nature and Causes

for sixty years after 1815 there were no significant colonial rivalries and an indifference to overseas empires, thought unnecessary to exercise political influence in areas in which one did business

## The New Imperialism

old colonialism: older empires had been maritime and mercantile; European traders

Europeans were no longer content simply by purchasing what local merchants offered
- wanted goods at a quantity that preindustrial handicraft methods couldn't supply
- moved into "backward" countries, investing capital 
- transformed large elements of the local population into the wage employees of foreign aowners and introduced the class problems of industrial Europe in a form accentuated by racial difference
- lent money to non-European rulers to support their thrones
	- developed huge financial stake in governments and economic enterprises outside Western civilization

now, Europeans aspired to political and territorial domination
- some became outright "colonies", governed by white men
- others became "protectorates", where they maintained the native ruler and guaranteed against internal upheaval or external conquest
- in regions where no single European state could make good its claims against the others, they divided the country into "spheres of influence", where each country had advisory privileges and investment and trade opportunities within its own sphere

about 1875, as Europe was growing more industrialized, civilized, and wealthy, all the principal non-European empires were in decay, receiving a minimum of support from their own subjects
- usually a mere show of force was sufficient for whites to impose their will
	- a garrison of only 75,000 white troops held India for the British
	- sporadic little wars constantly fought (Afghan wars, Burmese wars, Zulu wars)
	- Spanish-American War of 1898 and the Boer War of 1899
	- shadow of naval strength was enough

## Incentives and Motives 

Europeans couldn't maintain their style of life without plundering from the rest of the world
- required material goods, many of which only tropical regions could supply (ex. tea, coffee, cotton, rubber, petroleum, jute, coconut tree)

Catholic and Protestant groups sent missionaries to increasingly remote regions

Science required scientific expeditions for geographical, botanical, zoological, mineral, astronomical, or meteorological discoveries, 

Wealthy people traveled more, hunted tigers and elephants, etc

Industrial countries attempted to sell their own products - needed new markets
- neomercantilism: create a large self-sufficient trading unit

financial considerations: money invested in "backward" countries yielded a higher rate of return
- cheap labor, heavy and unsatisfied demand for non-European products, greater risk of losses 

J. A. Hobson, English socialist, wrote an influential book on imperialism in 1903
- if more of the national income went to workers as wages and less of it to  capitalists, there would be no surplus of capital and no real imperialism, and the working class would have more purchasing power and not need to look for new markets outside the country
- somewhat doubtful analysis; Europe's need for imports was more basic than capitalists' pressures to invest abroad
Lenin, *Imperialism, the Highest Stage of World CApitalism*, written in 1916

additionally, French investors had in 1914 a huge stake in the Russian empire, lending over $2 billion, more than to all colonial regions combined
- government urged French banks to buy Russian bonds
- aimed to make a profit for bankers and savers as well as to build up and hold together a military ally against Germany

Britain and Chamberlain: municipal socialism, including public ownership of utilities
- preached Britain's need for a "great self-sustaining and self-protecting empire" in an age of rising international competition
- saw with misgivings the tendencies toward independence in Canada, New Zealand, and the Australian Commonwealth
	- favored complete self-government but hoped that they would reknit their ties with each other and Great Britain once assured of their independence
- "imperial federation" - Britain and its dominions should pool resources not only for military defense but also for economic well-being

workers in western Europe likely benefited from imperialism
- Marxists thought this unfortunate because it made the proletariat opportunistic and unrevolutionary

specious argument: that European countries must acquire colonies to which surplus population could migrate without altogether abandoning the native land
- seemed unfortunate that so many Germans or Italians had emigrated to the US
- no European country after 1870 acquired any colony to which European families in any numbers wished to move

to keep balance amongst themselves, there was a scramble for colonies and territory, out of fear of other countries doing so first
- colonies came to have value in symbolism and prestige, a sign of greatness

## Imperialism as a Crusade

imperialism would bring civilization and enlightened living to those who still sat in darkness - faith in "modern civilization" became a religion and imperialism was its crusade

British: White Man's Burden, French: *mission civilisatrice*, Germans: diffusing *Kultur*, Americans: "blessings of Anglo-Saxon protection"

Social Darwinism: white races were "fitter" than colored
