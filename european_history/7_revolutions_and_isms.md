# 52. The Industrial Revolution in Britain

The Industrial Revolution is the process of shifting from hand tools to power machinery

People are habitually conservative
- the shifting to the modern machine of production requires a certain mobility of people and of wealth
	- Soviet Union: mobility produced by state planning
	- England: consequence of a long historical development

## The Agricultural Revolution in Britain

After the English Revolution of 1688, which confirmed the ascendancy of Parliament over the king (aka the ascendancy of middle class), until 1832, the British government was in the hands of landowners and London merchants
- "squirearchy"/"gentlemen of England"
- the result was an Agricultural Revolution: transformation of farming, basis of Industrial Revolution

landowners experimented with improved methods of cultivation and stock raising
- fertilizers
- implements (drill seeder/horse-hoe)
- new crops (turnips)
- system of crop rotation
- breed animals
- landlords needed full control over their land (gone with open fields, common lands, etc)
- investment of capital (impossible as long as the soil was tillted by poor and custom-bou small farmers)

only Parliament could modify the common rights of villagers, which were a part of the common law
- hence they passed hundreds of enclosure acts
- land came under a strict regime of private ownership and individual management
- ownership of land became concentrated in the hands of a few wewalthy landlords, who let it out to a small class of substantial farmers

results:
- raised productivity of land and farm labor
- hence labor increased for other pursuits, so the English workingman became a wage-laborer before the coming of the factory and the machine
	- **mobile** - went where the jobs were or where the wages were higher
	- available - fewer people needed on the land to produce food

## Industrialism in Britain: Incentives and Inventions

merchants had customers, ships, and capital due to colonialism
- hence they searched for more rapid methods of production, particularly for the English staple export, woolen cloth
	- infinite possibility in cotton cloth
only a country already wealthy from commerce and agriculture could have been the first to initiate the machine age

inventions in the textile industry
- 1733: John Kay, fly shuttle (only one person instead of two needed to operate a loom)
	- started strong demand for yarn
- 1760s: spinning jenny (mechanized spinning wheel)
- 1769: Richard Arkwright, water frame (device for the multiple spinning of many threads, at first operated by water power but later in the 1780s by the steam engine)
	- development of mills/factories because steam-powered equipment was heavy and unwieldy
- 1800: power loom
consequence: string on the production of raw cotton
- Eli Whitney: cotton gin (sped up the removal of seeds, increased the output of cotton)

Steam engine developments
- scientific and technical experiments with steam pressure common in the 17th century
- innovation forced by England's dwindling stocks of timber
	- difficult to obtain the charcoal needed in smelting iron
	- turned to coal
	- deeper coal shafts couldn't be sunk until someone devised better methods of pumping out water
- 1702: Thomas Newcomen, first economically significant steam engine
	- used to drive pumps in coal mines
	- consumed excessive fuel in proportion to power
- 1763: James Watt and Matthew Boulton, improvements on the steam engine
- 1807: Robert Fulton, used steam engine to propel river boats
	- started experiments with steam power for land transportation
- 1820s: steam engines on moving vehicles
	- 1829: George Stephenson's *Rocket*, on the newly built Liverpool and Manchester Railway
	- 1840s: era of railroad construction

the early industrial revolution in England and early factories were textile-based because people hesitated to diverge from the customary ways of the woolen trade, vs. the new cotton industry that could be easily mechanized

## Some Social Consequences of Industrialism in Britain

Population grew exponentially (tripled between 1750 to 1850, from 10 million -> 30 million)

Prominent cities:
- Manchester in Lancashire
	- the first and most famous of industrial cities
	- before cotton mills, it was a large market town
	- England had no concept of urban organization, so it was difficult for Manchester and other new factory towns that didn't inherit legal existence from the Middle Ages to deal with the problems of rapid urbanization
		- police protection
		- water and sewers
		- disposal of garbage

Factories only needed unskilled labors; skilled workers found themselves degraded in status
- pay for unskilled labor were too low to support a family
- women and children, who were paid less, were often preferred b/c of how mechanical the tasks were
- days were long, tedious, and oppressive, holidays were few, workers were unorganized (no unions)
- factory owners ("cotton lords") were the first industrial capitalists
	- self-made, honest and hard-working, believed the landed gentlemen idlers and the poor lazy
	- believed they did the poor a favor by furnishing them with work and ensuring that they worked diligently and productively
	- disapproved of public regulation of their business

Robert Peel, a cotton magnate, pushed in 1802 the first Factory Act
- regulated child labor
- useless because it provided no adequate body of factory inspectors

## Classical Economics: "Laissez Faire"

1776: Adam Smith's *Wealth of Nations*
- criticized mercantilism (regulatory/monopolistic practices)
- urged for "natural laws" of production and exchange
- followed by Thomas R. Malthus, David Ricardo, and the Manchester School
- "laissez faire," the free market regulated by "natural laws" such as the law of supply and demand or the law of diminishing returns
	- no tariffs, free trade
	- government should do as little as possible
	- people should follow their self interests b/c it'll lead to the general welfare+liberty of all
- workers shouldn't live more than subsistence because they thought that with excess, they would only breed more children and thus reduce themselves back to a subsistence level

Harsh conditions were not new because of the Industrial Revolution
- the concentration of working people made their misery apparent
	- philanthropic sentiment gradually aroused
	- workers obtained more knowledge, solidarity, class interest, and common political aims
		- established labor unions

# 53. The Advent of the "Isms"

An "ism" is the conscious espousal of a doctrine in competition with other doctrines
- people were making their ideas more systematic
- philosophy of the Enlightenment with the intense activism and partisanship generated during the French Revolution

## Romanticism

the only nonpolitical isms, a theory of literature and the arts
- questions on the nature of significant truth, the importance of various human faculties, on the relation of thought and feeling, on the meaning of the past and of time itself
- new way of sensing all human experience, affected thinking on social/public questions
- love of the unclassifiable that the intellect couldn't classify/box up/explain away/reduce to an abstract generalization
	- the mysterious, unknown, sublime
- insisted on the value of feeling as well as of reason
- new interest in strange and distant societies and epochs
	- looked back on the Middle Ages with respect and nostalgia 
	- Gothic Revival
- expression of an inner genius
	- genius made its own rules and laws
- impetus to study the past

People:
- Wordsworth, Shelly, and Byron in England
- Vitor Hugo and Chateau-briand in France
- Schiller and the Schlegels and others in Germany

## Classical Liberalism

liberals generally men of the business or professional classes, or enterprising landowners, wishing to improve their estates
- confidence in man's powers of self-government and self-control
- valued parliament and representative governments
	- reasonable discussion and legislation
- demanded full publicity for all actions of government
	- insisted on freedom of the press and assembly
- thought a good constitutional monarchy was most favorable
	- favored explicit written constitutions
	- opposed giving every man the vote, fearing irrational political action or mob rule
- believed in rights of man (particularly right of property), and laissez faire
- international freedom of trade (lowering/abolition of tariffs)
- frowned on established churches and landed aristocracies
- spread of tolerance and education
- disliked war and revolution
- admired Great Britain

## Radicalism, Republicanism, Socialism

Philosophical Radicals of England in 1820: working class leaders, new industrial capitalists
- like the French philosophes before the Revolution
- Jeremy Bentham: reform the English criminal and civil law, church, Parliament, and constitution
	- the right form of institutions from nature/psychology of man, rather than history/custom
	- "root" of things, total reconstruction of laws, courts, prisons, poor relief, municipal organization, rotten boroughs, and fox-hunting clergy
		- reform of Parliament
		- abolish royalty
- democratic: demanded a vote for every adult Englishman
	- after the Reform Bill of 1832, the industrial capitalists turned into liberals, while the working-class leaders remained radical democrats

militant republicanism (radicalism on the continent)
- First French Republic was to others the Reign of Terror, btu for republicans, years of hope and progress, cut short by forces of reaction
- minority in every country
- drawn from students and writers, working-class leaders protesting at social injustice, and elderly veterans who held the Republic of '93 in its full glory
- secret societies because of police oppression
- democrats demanding universal suffrage
	- favored parliamentary government but less concerned with its successful operation
- anticlerical (remembering the struggles between the church and the republic during the French Revolution)

republicanism shaded off into **socialism**
- similar attitudes of republicanism but also regarded the existing economic system as aimless, chaotic, and outrageously injust
	- improper for owners of wealth to have so much economic power
	- questioned value of private enterprise, favored some degree of communal ownership of productive assets
	- disliked competitions and rejected laissez faire, believed in more equal distribution of income among all useful members of society

one of the first socialists: Robert Owen of Manchester and the Scottish Lowlands
- created a model community
	- paying high wages, reducing hours, sternly correcting vice, building schools and housing and company stores
	- paternalistic capitalism
	- crusaded for social reforms

Count de Saint-Simon, nobleman 
- one of the first clear exponents of a planned society 
- public ownership of industrial equipment and other capital

Charles Fourier
- condemned all known institutions, proposed that society by organized into "phalansteries" of 1620 people
- established a few in the United States i.e. Brook Farm

most significant: movement stirring among the working classes of France, a compound of revolutionary republicanism and socialism
- were republican before the Revolution
- deep hostility to the bourgeoisie
- spokesperson: Louis Blanc, Paris journalist, editor of the *Revue de progrès* and author of the *Organization of Work*, one of the most constructive of the early socialist writings
	- system of "Social workshops", state-supported manufacturing centers
	- workers labor by and for themselves without the intervention of private capitalists

communism used as an uncertain synonym for socialism, used by Marx and Engels to differentiate their variety of socialism from utopians

## Nationalism: Western Europe

where national unity already existed, nationalism was more a latent state of mind

but where peoples of the same nationality were politically divided or subject to foreign rule, nationalism became a deliberate and conscious program/doctrine
- rising agitation over the national question
	- Italy of the Risorgimento, "resurgence"
	- eastern Europe of the Slavic Revival

cultural nationalism (people had a language, history, world view, and culture of its own) -> political nationalism (preserve a national culture)
- all persons of the same nationality (i.e. language) should be encompassed in the same state

nationalism was inherently revolutionary because these ideas couldn't be realized without the overthrow of every government in Europe east of France
- secret societies because of persecution by authorities
- nationalism mixed with socialism, liberalism, or revolutionary republicanism

Italian Joseph Mazzini
- spent most of his life in exile in France and England
- 1831: founded Young Italy, a secret society, and edited and smuggled into Italy copies of a journal of the same name
	- soon imitated by other societies, i.e. Young Germany
- wrote *The Duties of Man* 
	- pure duty to the nation was intermediate between duty to family and duty to God
	- moral philosopher
	- nationality and revolution was a holy cause

German nationality became an obsession
- affected everything
	- *Grimm's Fairy Tales* in 1812, trying to find the native, indigenous "spirit" of Germany
	- philosophy of Hegel
		- evident that for a people to enjoy freedom, order, or dignity it must possess a potent and independent state
		- state = institutional embodiment of reason and liberty, the "march of God through the world"
		- philosopher of unfolding change, the "dialectic" - the irresistible tendency of the mind to proceed by the creation of opposites; the thesis would produce the antithesis which would be followed by a reconciliation and a fusion of the two, the synthesis

Leopold von Ranke, founder of the "scientific" school of historical writing
- Europe owed its unique greatness to the coexistence and interplay of several distinct nations, which had always resisted the attempts of any one nation to control the whole (the France of Louis XIV and Napoleon)
	- German = not France

Friedrich List, *National System of Political Economy*
- political economy as taught in England was suited only to England
- founder of historical/institutional school of economics
- inspired by Henry Clay's American System
- any country, if it was to be civilized and develop its own national culture, must have cities, factories, industries, and capital of its own and therefore must put up high tariffs for protection

## Nationalism: Eastern Europe

for the most part nationalism remained more cultural than political
- upper classes looked to Vienna or to Paris for their ideas
- native languages and cultures remained peasant languages and cultures

early 19th century: patriots began demanding the preservation of their historic cultures
- collected folk tales and ballads, studied languages, composed grammars and dictionaries, wrote books in their mother tongue
- urged educated classes to give up foreign ways
- wrote histories of famous exploits of their people

Slavic Revival: included Russians, Poles, Ukrainians, Byelorussians, Ruthenians, Czechs, Slovaks, South Slavs (Slovenes, Croats, Serbs, and Bulgars)
- 1814: Serb Vuk Karajich published a grammar of his native tongue and a collection of *Popular Songs and Epics of the Serbs*, worked out a Serbian alphabet, translated the New Testament, declared that the dialect of Ragusa was to become the literary language of all South Slavs
	- opposed by the Serbian clergy, who preferred Slavonic, a purely learned language, like Latin
	- found much support outside of Serbia
- 1836: historian Palacky, *History of Bohemia* (in German) -> then in Czech, reentitled *History of the Czech People*
- Adam Mickiewicz

Russian Slavophilism slowly spread, and tended to merge into Pan-Slavism

## Other "Isms"

Conservatism: upheld institutions of absolute monarchy, aristocracy, and church and opposed the constitutional and representative government sought by liberals
- built on the ideas of Edmund Burke, people couldn't suddenly realize into the present any freedoms not already well-prepared in the past
- lacked appeal to people who viewed the past a series of misfortunes
- sometimes passed into nationalism, but the latter were often liberals or republicans

Monarchism: conservative and reactionary, aristocracy and monarchy wanted to maintain "the throne and the altar"

Humanitarianism: heightened sense of the reality of cruelty inflicted upon others
- torture gone
- conditions in prisons, hospitals, insane asylums, and orphanages improved
- misery of children, women, serfs, and slaves


# 54. The Dike and the Flood: Domestic

governments that defeated Napoleon wanted to assure themselves that history would not repeat itself
- Louis XVIII aspired to keep his throne for himself
- GB: Tory governing class hoped to preserve the old England that they had saved from the Bonaparte
- Germany, Austria, Italy, and central Europe: maintain the supreme prestige of the Habsburg dynasty
- Alexander: wanted to bring Christianity into politics, a crowned Jacobin, a liberal, a dreamer, feared by other rulers

arrangements made by victorious powers were moderate, (representative governments/assemblies)

difficult to maintain stability
- privileged classes denouced all signs of liberalism as dangerous concessions to revolution
- liberals, nationalists, and republicans regarded the newly installed regimes as hopelessly reactionary and inadequate
- statesmen terrified of revolution, so they repressed every sign of agitation, creating additional grievances -> vicious circle

## Reaction after 1815: France, Poland

France: 
- Louis XVIII could not control the counterrevolutionaries
- "white terror" - upper-class youths murdered Bonapartists and republicans who rallied to Napoleon when he returned from Elba
- 1820: revolutionary element assassinated the Duke de Berry
- 1824: Louis XVIII died and was succeeded by his brother Charles X, father of Duke de Berry, who stamped out revolutionary republicanism, liberalism, and constitutionalism

Poland:
- the Polish constitution and elected diet were virtually useless because Alexander didn't like to have anyone disagree with him
- serf-owning aristocracy in Russia were wary of Alexander's constitutional kingdom in Poland
- Poles were as national as they were liberal
	- secret societies
	- reaction and repression after they were discovered and broken up

## Reaction after 1815: The German States, Britain

Germany:
- nationalist ideas most common in universities
- glorification of the German common people, democratic opposition to aristocrats, princes, and kings
- students formed college clubs (the Burschenschaft) (Germany youth movement)
- Metternich regarded manifestations of German national spirit as a threat to the favorable position of the Austrian empire and to the whole balance of Europe
	- called conference of the principal German states at Carlsbad in Bohemia
	- they adopted the Carlsbad Decrees (1819), which dissolved the Burschenschaft and the equally nationalistic gymnastic clubs and placed government officials in universities and for censors
		- members joined secret societies
	- checked growth of liberal/nationalistic ideas in Germany
	- unable to persuade south German rulers to retract their constitutions because they found that with representative government, they could rally popular support and assimilate their new territories

Britain: 
- landed classes feared an inrush of imported agricultural products and consequent collapse of farm prices, so they raised protected tariffs and devastated wage earners
	- contributed to the spread of political radicalism
- riot in London in December 1816
	- government suspended habeas corpas and employed agents provocateurs to obtain evidence against the agitators
- industrialists of new factory towns organized mass meetings of protest
- demonstration at St. Peter's Fields in 1819: demanded univeresal male suffrage, annual election of the House of Commons, and the repeal of the Corn Laws
	- 11 killed and 400 wounded by soldiers
	- Peterloo massacre (by radicals)
- Parliament's Six Acts (1819) - outlawed seditious and blasphemous literature, stamp tax on newspapers, authorized the search of private houses for arms, and restricted the right of public meeting
- "Cato Street Conspiracy" - plot to assassinate the whole cabinet at a dinner
- Richard Carlisle spent 7 years in prison for publishing the writings of Thomas Paine

reactionary policies entrenched themselves everywhere due to the living fear of revolution in the present

# 55. The Dike and the Flood: International

Congress of Vienna -> resembled the League of Nations or the United Nations, subscribed to Alexander I's Holy Alliance
- suppression of revolutionary and liberal activity, following the trend of the governments which made it up

## The Congress of Aix-la-Chapelle, 1818

first general postwar assemblage
- withdraw the allied army of occupation from France
- private bankers took over the French reparations debt

Tsar Alexander suggested a permanent European union and the maintenance of international military forces to safeguard recognized states against changes by violence
- so governments would be more willing to grant constitutional and liberal reforms
- others demurred, especially Lord Castlereagh, British

discussing the suppression of both the Atlantic slave trade and the nuisance of the Barbary pirates
- required British's naval forces, but the continental states didn't want their naval power to increase and Britain refused to put its navy under international control, so nothing was done

growth of international institutions blocked by separate interests of sovereing states

## Revolution in Southern Europe: The Congress of Troppau, 1820

revolutionary agitation came to a crisis in southern Europe because the governments were inefficient, ignorant, flimsy, and corrupt (Spain, Naples, Ottoman Empire)

1820: governments of both Spain and Naples collapsed before the demonstrations of revolutionaries
- oaths to the Spanish constitution of 1812

Metternich called a meeting of the Great Powers at Troppau
- wanted to use authority of an international congress to put down the revolution in Naples
- GB and France only sent observers
- Alexander, although liberal, was disillusioned by the ungrateful feelings of the Poles and believed that constitutions should be granted by legitimate sovereigns and not extorted by revolutionaries, so he followed Metternich
	- radical tsar turned reactionary

Metternich drew up the protocol of Troppau
- European states should be protected by collective international action from internal changes brought about by force
	- collective security against revolution
- neither France nor GB accepted it
- only Prussia and Russia endorsed his protocol

Metternich thus dispatched an Austrian army into Naples; restored the incompetent and brutal Ferdinand I as an absolute king
- reaction won out
- but the Congress of Troppau created a divide between the three Eastern autocracies and the two Western powers

## Spain and the Near East: The Congress of Verona, 1822

revolutionaries in Italy fled to Spain and the Turkish empire seemed close to converting to a Greek empire and being dependent on Russia, which Metternich didn't want

international congress at Verona in 1822:
- Alexander stood by the principle of international solidarity against revolutionary violence and so refused to support Alexander Ypsilanti (Greek revolutionary)
	- less enthusiasm for Greek culture among Romanians and Balkan peoples than expected
	- Turks soon defeated Ypsilanti
- French government proposed and was authorized to dispatched an army across the Pyrenees into Spain, crushing the Spanish liberals, constitutionalists, and revolutionaries

## Latin American Independence

don't care :)

## The End of the Congress System

No meetings held after the Congress of Verona
- gave up on a formal international regulation of European affairs, because the congresses came to stand for nothing except preservation of the status quo, especially after Alexander's conversion to conservatism
- no attempt at accommodation with the new forces that were shaping Europe, repressing revolutionary agitation and propping up failing governments
- all action was fueled by separate interests of the Great Powers, not because of international principle (except maybe Alexander's repudiation of Ypsilanti)

## Russia: The Decembrist Revolt, 1825

Decembrist revolt:
- after Alexander I died in 1825, the question was, which of his two brothers, Constantine or Nicholas, would succeed him
- the army preferred Constantine, who they thought more favorable to innovations of the state
	- December 1825: "Constantine and Constitution!", proclaimed Constantine at St. Petersburg
- Constantine renounced his claims in favor of Nicholas, the rightful heir
	- the Decembrist revolt was put down

the revolt was the first manifestation of the modern revolutionary movement in Russia inspired by an ideological program

but it led to greater repression in Russia
- Nicholas I maintained an unconditional and despotic autocracy

# 56. The Breakthrough of Liberalism in the West: Revolutions of 1830-1832

By 1825, Spanish America was independent, and GB and France had pulled away from the Congress system

Greek nationalist movement
- after Ypsilanti's defeat in 1821, they turned to independence for Greece proper
- Tsar Nicholas assisted the movement, and GB and France didn't want to let Russia be the only champion of the Balkan peoples
	- western view of Greeks: ancient Athenians fighting the modern oriental despotism of the Turkish empire
	- joint Anglo-French-Russian naval intervention, then a Russo-Turkish land war and a great Near Eastern crisis
	- 1829: recognized Greece as an independent kingdom
	- Serbia, Wallachia, and Moldavia recognized as autonomous principalities
	- Egypt as autonomous region

## France, 1824-1830: The July Revolution, 1830

July Ordinances:
- in response to efforts to revive the Old Regime
	- Charles X became king in 1824
	- indemnity, perpetual annuities of 30 million francs/year for the emigres who had had their property confiscated
	- Catholic clergy  took over classrooms
	- death penalty for sacrilege
- March 1830: Chamber of Deputies passed a vote of no confidence in the government
	- king dissolved the Chamber in response and called for new elections
	- elections repudiated king's policies
- July 26, 1830: Charles issued four ordinances
	1. dissolved the newly elected Chamber
	2. imposed censorship on the press
	3. amended suffrage, moving power from bankers, merchants, and industrialists to the old-fashioned aristocracy
	4. called for a new election

July Revolution: July 27-29, in response to the July Ordinances
- republicans (revolutionary workers, students, and intelligentsia in Paris) moved
- barricades in Paris
- army refused to fire
- Charles X abdicated and fled to England, unwilling to be held captive like Louis XVI

New government:
- some leaders wanted a democratic republic
- working people wanted better conditions of employment
- political liberals wanted to continue a more liberalized constitutional monarchy with a trustworthy king
- the Marquis de Lafayette came forward as a symbol of national unity, offering the Duke of Orleans, a distant relative of the Bourbons, as the new king
	- reigned until 1848 as Louis Philippe

Orleanist/bourgeois/July Monarchy
- to other states of Europe and to clergy/legitimists in France, it was shockingly revolutionary
	- owed his throne to a resurrection and promises with the bourgeois/parliament
	- "king of the French"
	- flew tricolor French flag instead of the Bourbon flag
	- publicly strictly adhered to the constitution
		- constitution mostly the same as 1814, except it was changed to forbid absolutism
		- Chamber of Peers ceased to be hereditary and the Chamber of Deputies elected by double the number of voters
		- the upper bourgeoisie benefited the most
- to the big property owners, political progress ended here
- to others (particularly radical democrats), it was a disillusionment and an annoyance

## Revolutions of 1830: Belgium, Poland, and Elsewhere

Dutch and Belgium: joined by the Congress of Vienna to create a buffer state against France
- while it was economically beneficial, it crumbled politically
	- absolutist Dutch king vs. Belgians who wanted to preserve their local liberties
	- when the king took arms against them, they proclaimed independence (instead of just asking for local Belgian self-government)
	- national assembly met and drafted a constitution

Poland: buffer state against Russia
- Nicholas wanted to suppress the Belgian uprising, but the Poles objected to this and saw opportunity in the French revolutions
- January 1831: Polish diet proclaimed the dethronement of the Polish king (Nicholas)
	- in response, Nicholas sent in an army
	- without support, they were crushed
		- British government busy with internal agitation
		- French government didn't want to appear disturbingly revolutionary
- contributed to the success of the west-European revolution of 1830 by blocking Russia

France and Belgium wanted to merge, but Louis Philippe didn't want to cause trouble with the British, so the Belgians elected Leopold of Saxe-Coburg, a German princeling who had married into the British royal family
- Treaty of 1831: made Belgium a perpetually neutral state, incapable of forming alliances and guaranteed against invasion by all five Great Powers
- stable parliamentary system, more democratic than the July Monarchy in France but essentially liberal and bourgeois

liberalism was established in Switzerland

Spain entered a period of civil wars and torturous parliamentary development

Italy and Germany: the 1830 uprisings were quickly put down

## Reform in Great  Britain

England was already reforming to become steadily more liberal, the Tory regime loosening
- reduced tariffs and liberalized the old Navigation Acts
- allowed skilled workers to emigrate from England and for manufacturers to export machinery to foreign countries
- moved toward freedom of trade
- undermined legal position of Church of England, becoming more secular
- repealed Test Act of 1673 and adopted the Catholic Emancipation
	- Catholics received the same rights as others
- capital punishment abolished for ~100 offenses
- professional police force introduced

couldn't reform the Corn Laws, which protected their income, or the House of Commons, which they ruled by
- House of Commons had never been so unrepresented; no new boroughs had been created since the Revolution of 1688, and existing ones were concentrated in the South (many barely inhabited or controlled by corporations) despite the population migrating north to unrepresented factory towns

reforming the House of Commons
- two dozen bills introduced and failed prior to 1830
- 1830: the Whigs (the minority party) raised the issue again
	- the Tory prime minister, the Duke of Wellington, so immoderately defended the existing system that he lost the confidence of some of his own followers
	- Whig ministry then took over the government and introduced a reform bill
	- when the House of Commons rejected it, they resigned
	- the Tories, fearing popular violence, refused to take responsibility, so the Whigs resumed office and reintroduced their reform bill, which failed in the House of Lords
	- riots spread across England: only the passage of the bill could prevent an actual revolution
	- Whigs convinced king to promise to create enough peers to change the majority in the House of Lords, so the House of Lords yielded before it could happen
- Reform Bill of 1832 passed in April 1832
	- adapted the English/medieval system instead of the continental/French constitutions
		- members of the House of Commons represented boroughs and counties, inconsiderate of the size of population
		- complicated (although simplified) qualification for voting, depending on rents (instead of land because many important people didn't own any land)
	- redistribution by region and by class, reallocating seats in the House of Commons
		- 56 of the smallest older boroughs were abolished
		- 30 other small boroughs kept the right to send only one burgess to Parliament instead of 2
		- 143 seats given to new industrial towns, where the middle classes voted

no violent revolution in Britain because Parliament provided means by which social changes could be legally accomplished while enjoying universal respect

## Britain after 1832

new business interests joined the old aristocracy in the governing elite

Liberal party: aristocratic Whigs merged with radical industrialists and some Liberal Tories

Conservative party: main body of the Tories, a fwe old Whigs, and a few former radicals

the two parties alternated in power (Liberal-Conservative two-party system) until the First World War

Liberal consequences:
- 1833: slavery abolished
- 1834: Poor Law adopted
- 1835: Municipal Corporations Act modernized the local government of English cities, breaking up old oligarchies and bringing in uniform electoral and administrative machinery
- 1836: House of Commons allowed newspapers to report on their votes 
	- step toward publicity of government proceedings
- commission reviewed the Church of England and corrected their corruption

Tories in turn became champions of industrial workers
- social evils of rapid and ruthless industrialization
- Factory Acts of 1833 forbade child labor of children under 9
	- first effective one b/c it provided for paid inspectors and procedures for enforcement
- Act of 1842: forbade employment of women and girls and of boys under 10 in coal mines
- Ten Hours Act in 1847: limited women and child labor to 10 hours a day, which caused men to also only work 10 hours

Whig-liberal-radical established an Anti-Corn Law League in 1838
- tariff on grain imports kept food prices up, as well as wages and cost of production
	- England's disadvantage in the export trade
- defenders argued that it was necessary to preserve the aristocracy and to preserve a balanced economy between industry and farming

Repeal of the Corn Laws in 1846
- reaffirmed revolutionary consequences of the Reform Bill of 1832, industry was now a governing force
- free trade was now the rule and England became dependent on imports and the maintenance of a freely exchanging worldwide economic system
- also depended on British control of the sea, which was taken for granted and rarely mentioned

# 57. Triumph of the West-European Bourgeoisie

golden age for the West-European bourgeoisie, someone who is not of the nobility but enjoyed an income from business, a profession, or the ownership of property
- artists, literary people, and old-line aristocrats disdained them as uncultivated and only interested in amking money
- social theorists and working-class leaders: bourgeois was someone who could hire others to work for him, i.e. the bourgeois was the employer
- whereas the bourgeoisie was formerly identified in contrast to the nobility, it was now identified in contrast to the working class; they became more alike to the aristocracy ("new aristocracy")

"stake in society" liberal doctrine
- those who have something to lose should govern
- most of the bourgeoisie were enfranchised
- in Britain, the continuation of Tory landed interest blunted liberalism and led to significant legislation for the protection of industrial labor, which wasn't seen in France

consequences of the bourgeoisie 
- nations accumulated capital and national income steadily rose, although little went to the laboring class and more was spent on reinvestment rather than consumers' goods
	- new stock companies formed
	- law of corporations amended
- factory system spread to the Continent
- railroad building set in earnest after 1840
- much capital exported
- western England and especially England took the lead in a world economic system

## The Frustration and Challenge of Labor

France and Britain became committees of the bourgeois class
- worry for the prolteriat, those at the bottom of society
- republicans and radical democrats felt cheated, because they had fueled the revolution but had been left without the right to vote
- tempted to destroy the system when told that they couldn't change the system, and their only hope was leaving the working class altogether

emphasis of the labor market, where prices would fluctuate in accordance to changes in supply and demand
- Poor Law of 1834 was abhorrent because while it contributed to poor relief, it safeguarded the labor market by making relief highly unpleasant

increase in productivity is what improved the condition of the workers in the long run

two means of escape:
1. improve the position of labor in the market
	- formation of labor unions, which were illegal in France and barely legal in Britain, although it was still illegal in both countries to strike
2. repudiate idea of a market economy and capitalism
	- goods produced for use and working people compensated according to need
	- basis of most forms of nineteenth-century socialism

## Socialism and Chartism

Socialism in France:
- blended with revolutionary republicanism
- revival of interest in the great Revolution and the democratic Republic of 1793
- idolized Robespierre's writings

Socialism in Britain:
- blended with the movement for further parliamentary reform
- advanced by the working-class Chartists (they drafted a People's Charter in 1838)

Chartists:
- more of a mass movement than French socialism; few thought themselves as socialists, but all were anticapitalistic
- first step was to win working-class representation in Parliament
- Charter of 1838
	1. annual election of the House of Commons 
	2. universal suffrage for all adult males
	3. secret ballot
	4. equal electoral districts
	5. abolition of property qualifications for membership in the House of Commons
	6. payment of salaries to the elected members of Parliament, so that people of small means could serve
- convention met in London in 1839
- petition of over a million signatures urging the acceptance of the Charter submitted to the House of Commons
- wave of riots, which was quelled by authorities
- 1842: petition again submitted, signed by 3,317,702 people (out of GB's 19 million population)
- House of Commons again rejected the petition by 287 votes to 49
- irrationally feared that political democracy would threaten property rights and the entire economic system
- Chartist movement gradually died down

Overall:
- liberal, richer West that favored nationality
	- society rested on a working class that was repressed but hopeful, which resulted in the Revolution of 1848
- East of three autocratic monarchies that opposed principles of nationality

# 58. Paris: The Specter of Social Revolution in the West

the July Monarchy and the Chamber of Deputies became increasingly unrepresentative 
- strong movement to give the vote to more people instead of 1/30
- radicals wanted universal suffrage and a republic
- liberals wanted greater voting rights in the existing constitutional monarchy
- king Louis Philippe and his prime minister Guizot opposed all change, refusing to ally the liberals against the radicals

## The "February" Revolution in France

February 22, 1848: reformers planned a banquet in Paris with demonstrations in the street, against the king's expressed wishes
- night barricades built in the working-class quarters
- government called out the National Guard, which refused to move
- king promised electoral reform, but republican firebrands took charge
	- demonstreation outside the house of Guizot, wher 20 people died because someone shot at the guards and the guards shot back
	- republicanss paraded some of the corpses in a cart through the city

February 24: Louis Philippe abdicated and fled to England
- the February Revolution unseated a monarch in just three days, like the July Revolution
- constitutional reformers wanted Louis Philippe's young grandson as king, but the republicans forced the Chamber of Deputies to proclaim the Republic
	- provisional government of 10 men, election by all France of a Constituent Assembly
	- 7 were political republicans, 3 were social republicans
	- Louis Blanc, a social republican, urged the provisional government to push through a bold economic and social program, but because they were the minority, it was to little effect
		- Ministry of Progress to organize "social workshops" (collectivist manufacturing establishments) turned into a Labor Commission with limited power and a system of "national" shops instead of "social"
			- workshops agreed to only as a political concession and no significant work was ever assigned
			- Labor Commission unable to win public acceptance for the ten-hour day
	- abolition of slavery in the French colonies

National Workshop
- extensive project in unemployment relief as the number of legitimate unemployed rapidly increased because 1847 was a year of depression and revolution only exacerbated that

May 4: Constituent Assembly elected in April by universal male suffrage, met
- replaced Provisional Government with a temporary executive board of its own
- no "social" republicans; the new board were all members were Louis Blanc's enemies 

## The "June Days" of 1848

Revolutionary leaders became dissatisfied with the processes of majority rule and slow parliamentary deliberation, and they held no hesitation to violating elected assemblies

in National Workshops, where tens of thousands of the most distressed elements of the working class gathered to spread ideas, revolution stirred
- May 15: they attacked the Constituent Assembly, declared it dissolved, and set up a new provisional government of their own
	- needed a social revolution, after the purely political revolution of February
- National Guard turned on the insurgents and restored the Constituent Assembly
- Assembly abolished the workshops, offering the workers to join the army, transfer to provincial workshops, or to be put out of Paris by first
- laboring class in the city resisted, so the government proclaimed martial law and the civilian executive board resigned
- "Bloody June Days": June 24 to 26, 1848
	- over 20k men from the workshops took to arms, joined by thousands from working-class districts in the city
	- built a labyrinth of barricades in Paris
	- civilians shot out with soldiers
	- ultimately, the army triumphed, with 10k people killed or wounded and 11k taken prisoner, the Assembly declaring their immediate deportation to colonies

Consequences of the June Days
- class war had broken out
- militant workers confirmed hatred and loathing of the bourgeois
- people above the laboring class panicked and were terrified of revolution

Chartist temporarily revived by the February Revolution in Paris again but soon suppressed by the government due to a spy on the day of the insurrection

## The Emergence of Louis Napoleon Bonaparte

after the June Days, the Constituent Assembly drafted a republican constitution
- create a strong executive power in the hands of a president to be elected by universal male suffrage
- Louis Napoleon Bonaparte, one of four candidates, was overwhelmingly elected in December 1848

Louis Napoleon Bonaparte 
- born in 1808, Napoleon's nephew, his father, Louis Bonaparte, was the king of Holland
- elected because he was compromised neither by the June Days nor by their repression (since he had been exiled to the fortress of Ham after a failed attempt at seizing power to reclaim the glory of the empire, before walking out and joining several international revolutions), a supposed friend of the common people, a believer in order, and his name was Napoleon Bonaparte
	- name of Bonaparte was valuable because it was the only name many peasants had heard of

the Constituent Assembly dissolved itself in May 1849 and was replaced by the Legislative Assembly provided for in the new constitution
- royalist majority, but divided into irreconcilable factions (Legitimists, who favored the line of Charles X, and the Orleanists, who favored that of Louis Philippe)
- a third were republicans (some were socialists, others were old-fashioned/political republicans who only cared about the form of government)
- president and Assembly wanted to suppress socialism
- chance from an insurrection of june 1849
	- Assembly suppressed public meetings, imposed control on the press, and rescinded universal male suffrage (from the poorest, most socialistic third of the electorate)
	- Falloux Law of 1850: put schools under the supervision of the Catholic clergy
	- now antirepublican, it intervened against the revolutionary republic established by Mazzini in Rome, protecting the pope

Bonaparte knew that he had support of the monarchists because they would rather accept an antisocial regime than yield to the other faction
- needed to win over the radicals
- 1851: urged the restoration of universal suffrage after repealing it in 1850
- postured as people's friend
- December 2, 1851: he sprang his coup d'etat, dissolving the Assembly and reinstating the vote for every adult Frenchman
- on December 20th, he was elected president for a term of 10 years
- a year later, he proclaimed the empire and himself as Napoleon III, Emperor of the French

the republic had been dead sine June 1848; liberalism and constitutionalism was dead; France ceased to have any significant parliamentary life

# 59. Vienna: The Nationalist Revolution in Central Europe and Italy

## The Austrian Empire in 1848

the empire ruled from Vienna included Austria, Hungary, and Czechoslovakia, with parts of Poland, Romania, Yugoslavia, and Italy
- most influential member of the German confederation, subordinating Prussia
- Lombardy and Venetia in Italy were also a part of the Austrian Empire, while Tuscany was governed by a Habsburg grand duke, and the kingdom of Naples was virtually a protectorate of Vienna

they had felt the stirrings of a cultural nationalism, but Metternich, in Vienna, had discouraged this, predicting that if allowed to break out, it would produce the *bellum omnium contra omnes*
- he avoided the nationalities question, the fundamental problem of the century
- only offered the dated idea that a reigning house, with an official bureaucracy, should rule benevolently over people without the need for any connection

## The March Days

March 3: the Hungarian diet's leader, Louis Kossuth, gave a speech on the virtues of liberty
- heightened restlessness with the news from Paris

March 13: workingmen and students rose in insurrection in Vienna and invaded the imperial palace
- Metternich resigned and fled in disguise to England

revolution swept through the empire, Italy, and Germany
- March 15: rioting began in Berlin and the king of Prussia promised a constitution
- March 31: a Pre-Parliament met to arrange an all-German national assembly
- March 15: the Hungary diet enacted the March Laws
	- Hungary assumed a position of complete constitutional separatism within the empire, while still recognizing the Habsburg house
	- Bohemia was granted the same status a few days later
- March 18-22: in Milan, the populace drove out the Austrian garrison, Venice proclaimed itself an independent republic, Tuscany drove out its grand duke and set up as a republic
- March 23: king of Sardinia, Charles Albert, declared war on Austria and invaded Lombardy-Venetia, and had granted a constitution on March 4

consequences:
- Austrian Empire fell
- Prussia yielded to revolutionaries
- Germany prepared to unify itself
- war raged in Italy
- constitutions promised by governments, constitutional assemblies meeting, independent/autonomous nations appeared
- patriots demanded liberal government and national freedom
- serfdom declared abolished

## The Turning of the Tide after June

the revolution began ebbing in June
- old governments bided time to take back promises extorted by force
- revolutionary force was weak and internally divided: bourgeois interests were weakly developed and the working class wasn't as literate, so the middle and lower class began turning on and fearing each other
- peasants held no interest in revolution after emancipation and held no concept of nationality

the all-German national assembly met at Frankfurt in May
- Bohemia refused the invitation to attend and called an all-Slav congress of their own in Prague in June 1848
- continued the spirit of the Slavic Revival (i.e. anti-German), although it wasn't as anti-Austrian or anti-Habsburg

## Victories of the Counterrevolution: June-December

Habsburg didn't want anything to do with national movements, because they were also liberal
- June 12: the Habsburg army took control of Prague and dispersed the Slav congress
- they then destroyed Italy 
	- Radetsky, the Austrian commander in Italy, overwhelmingly defeated the king of Sardinia at Custozza on July 25
	- restored Lombardy and Venetia
- Count Jellachich, the provincial governor of Croatia, led a force of Serbo-Croatians, supported by the non-Magyar half of the country, against the Magyar national party in Hungary
	- became Emperor Ferdinand's military commander against the Magyars

October 1848: the revolutionaries saw the threat of Jellachich's army, so they rose in a second mass insurrection
- the emperor fled, but an Austrian military leader besieged Vienna for five days and forced its surrender on October 31
- counterrevolutionary leaders decided to clear the way by getting rid of Ferdinand, who ultimately abdicated; on December 2, 1848, Francis Joseph succeeded him

## Final Outburst and Repression, 1849

upheaval in Rome and Germany
- Pope Pius IX, now disillusioned by liberalism

August 1849: Emperor Francis Joseph invited Tsar Nicholas to intervene in Hungary and with the Magyars

reaction/antirevolutionism became the order of the day

Bach system:
- tried to create a perfectly solid and unitary political system of unparalleled administrative efficiency and material progress over Hungary to make the people forget about liberty
- although they never did

# 60. Frankfurt and Berlin: The Question of a Liberal Germany

## The German States

the Frankfurt Assembly possible b/c of the collapse of the existing German governments in the March Days of 1848
- German "dualism" between Berlin (Prussia) and Vienna (Austria), the two largest states

## Berlin: Failure of the Revolution in Prussia

Prussian monarchs (Frederick William III and his successor, Frederick William IV, who inherited the throne in 1840) were determined to avoid a modern constitution and the idea of sharing authority with their subjects
- government was efficient, progressive, and fair
- school/education surpassed those of western Europe, and literacy rates were higher than England or France
- mercantilist tradition of planning and supporting economic life
	- 1818: tariff union with tiny states enclosed within Prussia, later extended to include almost all of Germany

March 15, 1848: rioting broke out in Berlin
- Frederick William IV called off the soldiers and let the his subjects elect the first all-Prussian legislative assembly
	- surprisingly radical
	- dominated by anti-Junker lower-class extremists from East Prussia
	- supported Polish revolutionaries
	- believed that the fortress of reaction was tsarist Russia
	- hoped to destroy the Holy Alliance by raising an all-German or European revolutionary war against Russia
	- granted local self-government to the Poles of West Prussia and Posen, but the Germans refused to respect the authority of Polish officials and the Prussian army crushed the new pro-Polish institutions when the king changed his mind and the old authorities, through the army, were back in control

## The Frankfurt Assembly

disabling of the old governments left a power vacuum, so a self-appointed committee convoked a Pre-Parliament, which arranged for the election of an all-German assembly
- bypassed existing sovereignties
- voters sent delegates to Frankfurt to create a federated superstate
- represented moral sentiment of people at large
	- liberal and national aspirations
- no political power or preexisting national structure for it to work with
- became dependent on the power of the sovereign states that it was trying to superseded

May 1848: the assembly met
- members weren't revolutionary, overwhelmingly professional people
- wanted a liberal, self-governing, federally unified, and "democratic" (but not equalitarian) Germany
	- hoped to succeed by persuasion, not violence
	- but they couldn't be successful without lower-class insurrection
- September 1848: when radical riots broke out in Frankfurt, the Assembly appealed to the Prussian army to repress them and then met under its protection

Question of what Germany was and contained
- most were Great Germans: thought Germany should include all the Austrian lands except for Hungary
	- needed to offer the federal crown to the Habsburgs
- others were Little Germans, wanted Austria excluded
	- king of Prussia would become the federal emperor

the Assembly depended on the Austrian and Prussian armies because they wanted to retain non-German people in the new Germany
- ex. when Windischgratz broke the Czech revolution
- when Prussian forces put down the Poles in Posen
- diff between the Frankfurt Assembly and the Berlin Assembly
- Schleswig: the Assembly needed the Prussian army, but they withdrew when GB and Russia prepared to intervene, because they didn't want to antagonize them
- fatal dependency on Austrian/Prussian forces

## The Failure of the Frankfurt Assembly

nationalists, bickering amongst themselves, hastened the return of the old absolutist and nonnational order

December: the Frankfurt Assembly issued a Declaration of the Rights of the German people
- similar to French and American declarations
- announced individual rights, civil liberties, and constitutional guarantees  for the German people
- because Austria and the Danubian empire refused to join, the Little Germans had their way and they offered the crown to Frederick William IV, the king of Prussia
	- while tempted, he would have to force himself on the lesser states because the Frankfurt Assembly had no power, so he declared that he would not "pick up a crown from the gutter" 
- hence Frankfurt Assembly rendered useless

## The Prussian Constitution of 1850

Prussian monarch issued a Prussian constitution of his own, effective from 1850-1918
- granted a single parliament for all the miscellaneous regions of Prussia, which met in two chambers
	- lower chamber = elected by universal male suffrage that divided the population into three states (the wealth, the less wealthy, and the common people) according to pay of taxes
- fairly progressive, despite the massive favoritism to large property owners
- but in 1918, because it remained unchanged, it became reactionary and illiberal

# 61. The New Toughness of Mind: Realism, Positivism, and Marxism

The Revolution of 1848 = "the springtime of the peoples" 
- failed in Germany, Hungary, Italy, and France
- visions of a humane nationalism, aspirations for liberalism without violence, ideals of a peaceful and democratic republican commonwealth, all exploded

consequences of the 1848 revolutions:
- nowhere was national liberty more advanced in 1850 than two years prior
- one accomplishment: peasantry emancipated in the German states and Austrian empire
	- peasant emancipation strengthened the forces of political counterrevolution 
- new toughness of mind: idealism discredited
	- revolutionaries less optimistic
	- conservatives more willing to repress
	- proud to be realistic and not idealistic
	- industrialization charged forward

## Materialism, Realism, Positivism 

mental toughness appeared as materialism in basic philosophy
- everything mental, spiritual, or ideal was an outgrowth of physical or physiological forces
- "realism" in literature and the arts
- broke away from romanticism
- increased trust in science
- skepticism toward religion because it was unscientific and irrelevant to modern civilization/unserious
	- radical counterpart: religion was a bourgeois invention to delude the people

positivism
- originated wit the French philosopher Auguste Comte, who published volumes on *Positive Philosophy* from 1830 into the 1850s
- human history as a series of three stages: the theological, the metaphysical, and the scientific 
- revolutions of France suffered from excess metaphysical abstractions
- elaborate classification of the sciences; people need to adopt a strictly scientific outlook
- insistence on verifiable facts, avoidance of wishful thinking, questioning of all assumptions, dislike of unprovable generalizations
- demand for observation of facts and testing of ideas
- aspiration to be humanly useful

*Realpolitik* - politics of reality
- give up on utopian dreams and be content with an orderly, honest, hard-working government
	- radicals: no hope for new society resulting from goodness or love of justice
	- social reformers needed to resort to methods of politics (power and calculation)
- governments shouldn't be guided by ideology; instead, follow their own practical interests and make alliances as necessary, disregard tastes and scruples, use any practical means to achieve their ends
- war accepted as an obvious means sometimes necessary to achieve a purpose

## Early Marxism

Marx (1818-1883)
- son of a lawyer in the Prussian Rhineland, studied law and philosophy at German universities

Engels (1820-1893)
- son of a well-off German textile manufacturer, sent to Manchester in England to learn the business and then manage it

1844: Marx and Engels met in Paris and began a collaboration in thinking and writing 
- 1847: joined the Communist League, aka the German branch of the French secret societies
	- crushed after the triumph of the counterrevolution in Germany
	- January 1848: Marx and Engels wrote their *Communist Manifesto* for this League
	- Engels returned to his factory at Manchester, and Marx settled in London (ultimately producing *Capital*)

## Sources and Content of Marxism

Marxism mixed Germany philosophy, French revolutionism, and the British Industrial revolution
- Marx had mingled with the Young Hegelians as a student in Germany
	- resisted repressive measures that prevailed in Germany after Napoleon's defeat
	- believed that the promise of the French Revolution had not yet been fulfilled because of the lack of social and economic equality, after civil and legal equality already won
	- hoped for more personal emancipation from society, government, and religion
- "alienation" - when people become estranged from product b/c of mechanization, the commercialization of labor, and the ownership of property by others than the workers

belief that true freedom was only possible when private property in capital goods was abolished

1844: Engels published *The Condition of the Working Classes in England*
- drew the same conclusions from facts that Marx drew from philosophical analysis and historical study

*Communist Manifesto* - a summons to revolution
- outbreak of revoluition in France in February confirmed their beliefs
- June Days in Paris was taken as a manifestation of a universal class struggle
- inflammatory
	- worker deprived of the wealth he had himself created
	- state a committee of the bourgeoisie for the exploitation of the people
		- religion drug to keep the worker quietly dreaming
		- worker's family prostituted and brutalized by the bourgeoisie
		- uprooted worker should only by loyal to his own class
		- country meaningless

subsistence theory of wages./Iron Law , derived from British political economy
- average worker would never obtain more than a minimum level of living

labor theory of value
- value of any man-made object depended ultimately on the amount of labor put into it
- capital was the stored up labor of former times
- doctrine of surplus value: workers were being robbed, the difference between wages and value were expropriated by the bourgeois capitalists
- capitalism menaced by overproduction because people couldn't afford to buy
- evidence: depression of 1847

dialectical materialism
- all change comes through the clash of antagonistic elements because all things are in movement and evolution
- all history is necessary, logical, and deterministic (like Hegel)
- Hegel emphasized the primacy of ideas in social change, while Marx emphasized the primacy of material conditions, or the relations of production

material conditions give rise to economic classes
- agrarian conditions produce a landholding/feudal class 
- with increases in trade routes, money, and productive techniques, a new commercial/bourgeois class arises
- each class develops an ideology to suit its needs
- prevailing religions, governments, laws, and morals reflect the outlook of these classes
- the two classes inevitably clash
- bourgeois revolutions against feudal interests break out
- as the bourgeois class develops, it calls its dialectical antithesis into being, the proletariat 
- ultimately, the proletarianized mass takes over from the bourgeois, abolishing the old private property in the means of production
- the social revolution is thus accomplished and a classless society results because economic differences have disappeared, hence classes have nothing to rise from
- "dictatorship of the proletariat" until the danger of counterrevolution has been overcome, then the state will "wither away"
- call to war because the bourgeois and the proletarian are locked in a universal struggle
- it is a betrayal of their class for workers to rise above the proletariat
- law is the will of the stronger; law/morals are bourgeois law, government, and morals

## The Appeal of Marxism: Its Strength and Weaknesses

strengths:
- claim to be scientific and nonutopian
-  strong compound of the scientific, historical, metaphysical, and apocalyptic

weaknesses:
- working people hesitated to sacrifice everything for the distant prospect of a class revolution
- not exclusively class-people; religion, old customs, national loyalties

"cure" for the revolutionism of 1884:
- greater rights and conditions for laboring classes
- wages rose, labor unions organized, workingman had a vote
