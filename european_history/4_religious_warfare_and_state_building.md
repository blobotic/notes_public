### The Ambitions of Philip II

1556: Charles V, after 35 years of preserving religious unity in Germany, abdicated his many crowns and retired to a monastery, a year after the Peace of Augsburg
- Austria, Bohemia, Hungary to his brother Ferdinand, soon elected HRE
- everything else left to his son Philip II of Spain
    - 1580: Philip inherited Portugal
    - had the 17 provinces of the Netherlands and the Free County of Burgundy
    - had Milan, Naples, the chief islands, and Tunis, so he dominated the western Mediterranean, threatened only by the Turks
    - 5 years, until 1558: titular king of England
    - 1589: claimed France's throne in his daughter's name
    - America and, after 1580, all the Portuguese empire belonged to PHilip
- Habsburg dynasty divided into two branches
    - Austrian
    - Spanish (more important for a century)

Philip II
- fanatical Catholic, committed to upholding the sway of the universal church
- sacrificed his kingdom's blood and treasure for a Catholic counteroffensive
    - wealth of Potosi solved all economic problems
    - Spain entered a Golden Age of its culture even as society began to deteriorate
- *siglo de oro*: 1550-1650
    - Cervantes wrote his *Don Quixote*
    - Lope de Vega wrote his 700 dramas
    - El Greco, Murillo, and Velazquez painted
    - the Jesuit Suarez composed works on philosophy and law
    - church vitally present at every social level
    - 1600: a third of the population of Spain was in the service of the church
- Escorial: Philip II built a new royal residence in honor of St. Lawrence, on who feast day he had won a battle against the French
    - 30 miles from Madrid (a new town) on the arid plateau of central Castile, overlooked by the jaggd Sierra
    - shape of a grill since St. Lawrence in 258 had been roasted alive on a grill over burning coals
    - both a palace and a monastery and mausoleum
- elsewhere in Europe:
    - national unity was dissolving; people were closer to those of the same faith
    - Calvinists in England, France, and the Netherlands were  close
    - zealous Catholics welcomed the Jesuits, the king of Spain, and the pope
    - people turned against each other in the name of a higher cause
- 5 years: seemed like Catholicism was prevailing
    - 1567: Philip sent the Duke of Alva to te Netherlands with 20,000 Spanish soldiers
        - he established a Council of Troubles, suppressing religious and political dissidents
    - 1569: Philip put down a revolt by the Mriscos in Spain

    - 1570: the pope excommunicated Elizabeth and absolved her subjects from allegiance to her
    - 1571: Spanish won a naval battle against the Turks at Lepanto off the coast of Greece
    - 1572: Catholic leaders of France seized and massacred over three thousand Huguenots on the eve of St. Bartholomew's Day in Paris
        - other massacres followed after
    - these victories were unenduring and in the long run, most were failures/inconsequential

### The Revolt of the Netherlands

Netherlands: 17 proinces
- language
    - northern provinces: people spoke German dialects
    - southern provinces: dialects of French
    - language boundaries did **not** define political borders
- southern provinces were commercial centers (Antwerp)
- northern provinces (Holland and Zeeland) developed rapidly, developing their own popular literature and their own dialect of German, later called Dutch
    - where the Brothers of the Common Life had originated
    - Erasmus of Rotterdam born here
    - wealth from deep-sea fishing
- each province was a small state/country, enjoying all the medieval liberties, privileges, and immunities
    - constitution of the Netherlands: *Joyeuse Entree*
- only common tie: starting with the dukes of Burgundy, they had the same ruler
    - occasionally called to send delegates to an estates general
    - developed a sense of federal collaboration
    - Netherlands identity heightened with the accession of Philip II, who was foreign, a Spaniard
- since the Netherlands was the crossroads of Europe, Protestant ideas took root
    - 1560, after religious wars began in France, French Calvinists fled across the borders
- more Calvinists in the southern provinces (Belgians) than the north (Dutch) at first

revolt was both political and religious, then increasingly economic
- 1566: ~200 nobles (both Catholic and Protestant) founded a league to check the "foreign" / Spanish influence in the Netherlands
    - petitioned Philip II not to employ the Spanish Inquisition in the Netherlands
        - feared it as a foreign court
        - that it would destroy their liberties
    - Philip's agents refused
    - a revolt broke out
    - in a week, Calvinists pillaged 00 churches and spread across the Netherlands
        - primarily journeymen wage earners, aroused by social and economic grievances as well as religious belief
    - in the light of this vandalism, many petitioning nobles and less militant Protestants withdrew 
    - appalled  Philip II sent in the Inquision, the Duke of Alva, and Spanish reinforcements
- Alva's Council of Troubles
    - nicknamed the Council of Blood
    - sentenced thousands to death, levied new taxes, and confiscated nobles' estates
    - united people of all classes in opposition, turning an originally primarily class conflict into a character of national opposition
- William of Orange (William the Silent), Philip II's "stadholder"/lieutenant in Holland
    - issued letters of marque to make war at sea
    - Spanish reciprocated by renewing confiscations, inquisitorial tortures, burnings, and hangings
- 1576: representatives of all 17 provinces put aside religious differences to form a union to drive out the Spanish at any cost

### The Involvement of England

Queen Elizabeth secretly lent aid to the Netherlands
- didn't want to provoke war with Spain out of fear that English catholics would side with the Spaniards
- troubled by Mary Queen of Scots, a Catholic who had been queen of France until her husband's premature death and queen of Scotland until driven out by irate Calvinist lords, that was a contender to the throne
    - kept Mary Stuart imprisoned
- 1576: Don Juan, hero of Lepanto and half-brother of Philip II, became governor general of the Netherlands and wanted to put Mary Stuart on the throne and marry her to become king of a re-Catholicized England
    - prompted Elizabeth to ally with Netherlands patriots

Division of the Netherlands
- 1578: after Don Juan died, the prince of Parma succeeded him as governor general
    - promised the historic liberties of the *oyeuse Entree* would be respected
    - appealed to both zealous Catholics and moderates
    - rallied the southernmost provinces to his side
- in response, the seven northern provinces formed the Union of Utrecht in 579
    - 1581: formally declared independence from the king of Spain as the United Provinces of the Netherlands
- when Parma moved on Antwerp, the leading port of the orth Sea, Elizabeth openly entered war
    - sent 6,000 English troops to the Netherlands under the Earl of Leicester in 1585

Spanish invasion of England
- England emerged as the chief bulwark of Protestantism and anti-Spanish feeling
    - unprecedented national solidarity
        - fears of spain
        - resentment against Catholic plots with Mary Stuart
        - indignation of "foreign" and "outside" meddling in English matters
    - openly and defiantly allied with the Protestant Dutch
        - raided Spanish shipping
        - pllaged the Spanish Main, the mainland coast of northern South America
- Philip II prepared to invade England 
    - cheaper to launch an attack of England than to protect Spanish galleons year after year
    - 1587:; English executed Mary Stuart, demanded by Parliament
    - Sir Francis Drake sailed into hte port of Cadiz and burnt the ships assembling there to join the Armada
- *aramada catolica*: ready in early 1588
    - 130 ships, 58,000 tons, 30,000 men, 2,400 pieces of artillery
    - few notied its weaknesses: its commander no seaman, ships too cumbersome, too frail, orders had to be issued in six languages, and the antagonisms between different countries had to be appeased
    - planned to sail to the Netherlands then escort the prince of Parma's army across the straits to the English coast
    - in the Channel: Sir Francis Drake as vice admiral under Lord Howard of Effingham and 200 English vessels faced the Armada
    - when it retreated, at Calis, English fireships drove it out to sea
    - "Protestant wind" blew the Armada northward into waters they couldn't sail, killing countless


### The Results of the Struggle

war continued for several years

Philip died in 1598 after a long illness

the English had assured their national independence and acquired an intense national spirit
- took to the sea with the ruin of the Armada

Netherlands:
- 1609: Twelve Years' Truth
    - partitioned the Netherlands farther north than in Parma's time, because the Spaniards had retaken Antwerp and other cities in the middle zone
    - Dutch: the seven provinces from the Union of Utrecht in 1579
        - since a third remained Catholic, they adopted a policy of toleration
    - Spanish Netherlands (Belgium): the 10 provinces south of the line
        - ruined after 40 years of war and with the Dutch  refusing to allow vessels to proceed to Antwerp or to Ghent, these cities died, giving way to Amsterdam becoming the commercial and financial center of northern Europe
- took to the sea
    - 160: Dutch East India Company organized
    - 1607: English settled in Virginia
    - 1612: Dutch settled in New York

Spain's internal decline began
- monarchs depended on the next arrival of treasure from the Indies
- production weakened by inflation, taxation, emigration, and depopulation
- the massive numbers of minor aristocrats, chevaliers, dons, and hidalgos from the Crusades were contemptuous of work, and the ablest men entered the church
- people disdained secular activities
- began hunting the Moriscos again, which included some of the best farmers and most skilled artisans in the country
    - 1609: 150,000 driven out of Valencia
    - 1610: 64,000 driven from Aragon
    - 1611: many expelled from Castile
    - Spain lost one of the most socially valuable of all its minorities
- 1640: Portugal reestablished its independence and Catalonia rose in open rebellion
    - Catalan war lasted for almost twenty years, the French supporting the rebels
- Spanish kingdoms almost as disunited as in the days of Isabella and Ferdinand


## 15. The Disintegration and Reconstruction of France
[Top](#unit-4-religious-warfare-and-state-building)

### Political and Religious Disunity

the Wars of Religion were equally religious, political, and feudal rebellion
- the New Monarcchy, resuming the work of medieval kings, united the country
    - the country acted as a unit in foreign affairs, apart from civil war
    - king alone made treaties
    - subjects fought for king
- royal centralization was largely administrative
- underneath the platform of royalty, there was little substantial unity in France
    - three hundred areas with their own legal systems
    - *bonnes villes* - like the HRE's free cities, which defended their corporate rights
    - France had provinces as great as some European kingdoms that each ahd their own identity, autonomy, laws, courts, tariffs taxes, and parliament/provincial estates
    - diversity in religion with the spread of Calvinism (Huguenots)

French Catholicism was independent from Rome and the papacy
- French clergy struggled for its Gallican liberties
- French kings deal rudely with popes, ignored the Council of Trent, and allied for political reasons with both the Lutherans and the Turks
- lay investiture

French Protestantism was extreme
- 1560/1570s: >1/3 and near 1/2 of French nobility was Protestant
    - believed in the *ius reformandi*, the right to regulate religion on their own estates
    - turned the peasants on their lands into Huguenots
    - primarily spread in southwestern France

both Francis I and Henry II opposed the spread of Calvinism because it threatened the powers of the monarchy and the idea of a nationally established church
- because of how prominent the French nobility featured, it looked like a political/feudal rebellion
- 1559: Henry II was accidentally killed in a tournament
    - 3 son, the eldest 15
    - mother was Catherine de Medici, who tried to govern the country for her royal sons
- with no firm hand in control of the monarchy, the country fell apart
- the Huguenots, under persecution, took up arms
    - they had >1/3rd of the professional warrior class, the nobles

### The Civil and Religious Wars

unorganized conflict - 9 civil wars in the concluding 4 decades of the 16th century in France
- roving bands of armed men
- prominent leaders easily gathered followers
- peasants would take to the woods or form protective leagues (vigilantes); the bourgeois would lock the gates to their cities
- Huguenots led by various ranks
    - Admiral de Coligny
    - Henry of Bourbon, king of Navarre
    - some fought for local liberties, others wanted to drive out idolatry and popery from France
- Catholic party rose under the Guise family
    - headed by the Duke of Guise and the Cardinal of Lorraine
    - wanted to exterminate heresy and to govern France

    - at first tried to play them against each other
    - 1572: fearing hte growing influence of Coligny and a concourse of leading Huguenots in Paris to celebrate Henry of Navarre's marriage, at the massacre of St. Bartholomew's Day, she massacred thousands of Huguenots after midnight 
    - Coligny was killed
    - Henry of Navarre escaped by temporarily changing his religion
    - caused Huguenot fury and a renewal of civil war
- both parties hired parties of mercenary soldiers, mainly from Germany
- Spanish troops invaded at the invitation of the Guises
- Protestant towns appealed to Elizabeth of England, but she was too preoccupied
- truces acknowledging the status quo were common, but fighting often broke out in the midst of them because no side had the power to enforce them
- *politiques* - developed among the more perfunctory Catholics and moderate Protestants
    - concluded too much was being made of religion
    - secular view
    - Henry of Navarre and the political philosopher Jean Bodin (1530-1596), the first thinker to develop the modern theory of sovereignty
    - idea of royal absolutism and of the sovereign state

### The End of the Wars: Reconstruction under Henry IV

1589: both Henry III, the reigning king, and Henry of Guise, the Catholic party chief trying to depose him, were assassinated

Henry of Navarre, the Huguenot chieftain, reigned as Henry IV
- first of the Bourbon dynasty
- Catholic party refused to recognize him and the Huguenots had become an increasingly unpopular minority

    - Huguenots, alarmed, demanded guarantees of religious liberty
- 1598: Henry IV eissued the Edict of Nantes
    - granted every seigneur the right to hold Protestant services in his own household and allowed Protestantism in towns where it was the prevailing form of worship, and in any case, in one town of each *bailliage* throughout the country
    - barred Protestantism from Catholic episcopal towns and a zone surrounding Paris
    - promised that Protestants would enjoy the same civil rights as Catholics (chance for public offices, access to Catholic universities)
    - creatied mixed chambers of both Protestants and Catholics in certain superior law courts
    - granted 100 fortified towns to be held by Protestant garrisons under Protestant demand
- Huguenots were appeased, but everyone else refused to recognize the edict
- the king forced toleration on the country
- he worked to rebuild France, putting the ruined government back together, collecting taxes, paying officials, disciplining the army, and supervising the administration of justice
- the Estates Gerneral was never called during his reign
- Henry IV laid the foundations of royal absolutism
- assassinated in 1610 by a fanatic who believed him a meance to the Catholic church
- his widow, Marie de Medici, was forced by the upper Catholic clergy to summon the Estates General, but it was so conflicted and chaotic that Marie dismissed them in 1615 to everyone's general relief and they never met again until after the French Revolution

### Cardinal Richelieu

Cardinal Richelieu, a *politique*, rose to power in the name of MArie de Medici and her young son, Louis XIII
- tried to strengthen the state economically through mercantilism
- allowed nobles to engage in maritime commerce without loss of noble status
- made it possible for merchants to become nobles in return for payments into the royal exchequer
