- Austria, Bohemia, Hungary to his brother Ferdinand, soon elected HRE
- everything else left to his son Philip II of Spain
    - 1580: Philip inherited Portugal
    - had the 17 provinces of the Netherlands and the Free County of Burgundy
    - had Milan, Naples, the chief islands, and Tunis, so he dominated the western Mediterranean, threatened only by the Turks
    - 5 years, until 1558: titular king of England
    - 1589: claimed France's throne in his daughter's name
    - America and, after 1580, all the Portuguese empire belonged to PHilip
- Habsburg dynasty divided into two branches
    - Austrian
    - Spanish (more important for a century)

Philip II
- fanatical Catholic, committed to upholding the sway of the universal church
- sacrificed his kingdom's blood and treasure for a Catholic counteroffensive
    - wealth of Potosi solved all economic problems
    - Spain entered a Golden Age of its culture even as society began to deteriorate
- *siglo de oro*: 1550-1650
    - Cervantes wrote his *Don Quixote*
    - Lope de Vega wrote his 700 dramas
    - El Greco, Murillo, and Velazquez painted
    - the Jesuit Suarez composed works on philosophy and law

    - 1600: a third of the population of Spain was in the service of the church
- Escorial: Philip II built a new royal residence in honor of St. Lawrence, on who feast day he had won a battle against the French
    - 30 miles from Madrid (a new town) on the arid plateau of central Castile, overlooked by the jaggd Sierra
    - shape of a grill since St. Lawrence in 258 had been roasted alive on a grill over burning coals
    - both a palace and a monastery and mausoleum
- elsewhere in Europe:
    - national unity was dissolving; people were closer to those of the same faith
    - Calvinists in England, France, and the Netherlands were  close
    - zealous Catholics welcomed the Jesuits, the king of Spain, and the pope
    - people turned against each other in the name of a higher cause
- 5 years: seemed like Catholicism was prevailing

    - 1572: Catholic leaders of France seized and massacred over three thousand Huguenots on the eve of St. Bartholomew's Day in Paris
        - other massacres followed after
    - these victories were unenduring and in the long run, most were failures/inconsequential

### The Revolt of the Netherlands

Netherlands: 17 proinces
- language
    - northern provinces: people spoke German dialects
    - southern provinces: dialects of French
    - language boundaries did **not** define political borders
- southern provinces were commercial centers (Antwerp)
- northern provinces (Holland and Zeeland) developed rapidly, developing their own popular literature and their own dialect of German, later called Dutch
    - where the Brothers of the Common Life had originated
    - Erasmus of Rotterdam born here
    - wealth from deep-sea fishing
- each province was a small state/country, enjoying all the medieval liberties, privileges, and immunities
    - constitution of the Netherlands: *Joyeuse Entree*
- only common tie: starting with the dukes of Burgundy, they had the same ruler
    - occasionally called to send delegates to an estates general
    - developed a sense of federal collaboration
    - Netherlands identity heightened with the accession of Philip II, who was foreign, a Spaniard
- since the Netherlands was the crossroads of Europe, Protestant ideas took root
    - 1560, after religious wars began in France, French Calvinists fled across the borders
- more Calvinists in the southern provinces (Belgians) than the north (Dutch) at first

revolt was both political and religious, then increasingly economic
- 1566: ~200 nobles (both Catholic and Protestant) founded a league to check the "foreign" / Spanish influence in the Netherlands
    - petitioned Philip II not to employ the Spanish Inquisition in the Netherlands
        - feared it as a foreign court
        - that it would destroy their liberties
    - Philip's agents refused
    - a revolt broke out
    - in a week, Calvinists pillaged 00 churches and spread across the Netherlands
        - primarily journeymen wage earners, aroused by social and economic grievances as well as religious belief
    - in the light of this vandalism, many petitioning nobles and less militant Protestants withdrew 
    - appalled  Philip II sent in the Inquision, the Duke of Alva, and Spanish reinforcements
- Alva's Council of Troubles
    - nicknamed the Council of Blood
    - sentenced thousands to death, levied new taxes, and confiscated nobles' estates
    - united people of all classes in opposition, turning an originally primarily class conflict into a character of national opposition
- William of Orange (William the Silent), Philip II's "stadholder"/lieutenant in Holland
    - issued letters of marque to make war at sea
    - Spanish reciprocated by renewing confiscations, inquisitorial tortures, burnings, and hangings
- 1576: representatives of all 17 provinces put aside religious differences to form a union to drive out the Spanish at any cost

### The Involvement of England

Queen Elizabeth secretly lent aid to the Netherlands
- didn't want to provoke war with Spain out of fear that English catholics would side with the Spaniards
- troubled by Mary Queen of Scots, a Catholic who had been queen of France until her husband's premature death and queen of Scotland until driven out by irate Calvinist lords, that was a contender to the throne
    - kept Mary Stuart imprisoned
- 1576: Don Juan, hero of Lepanto and half-brother of Philip II, became governor general of the Netherlands and wanted to put Mary Stuart on the throne and marry her to become king of a re-Catholicized England
    - prompted Elizabeth to ally with Netherlands patriots

Division of the Netherlands
- 1578: after Don Juan died, the prince of Parma succeeded him as governor general
    - promised the historic liberties of the *oyeuse Entree* would be respected
    - appealed to both zealous Catholics and moderates
    - rallied the southernmost provinces to his side
- in response, the seven northern provinces formed the Union of Utrecht in 579
    - 1581: formally declared independence from the king of Spain as the United Provinces of the Netherlands
- when Parma moved on Antwerp, the leading port of the orth Sea, Elizabeth openly entered war
    - sent 6,000 English troops to the Netherlands under the Earl of Leicester in 1585

Spanish invasion of England
- England emerged as the chief bulwark of Protestantism and anti-Spanish feeling
    - unprecedented national solidarity
        - fears of spain
        - resentment against Catholic plots with Mary Stuart
        - indignation of "foreign" and "outside" meddling in English matters
    - openly and defiantly allied with the Protestant Dutch
        - raided Spanish shipping
        - pllaged the Spanish Main, the mainland coast of northern South America
- Philip II prepared to invade England 
    - cheaper to launch an attack of England than to protect Spanish galleons year after year
    - 1587:; English executed Mary Stuart, demanded by Parliament
    - Sir Francis Drake sailed into hte port of Cadiz and burnt the ships assembling there to join the Armada
- *aramada catolica*: ready in early 1588
    - 130 ships, 58,000 tons, 30,000 men, 2,400 pieces of artillery
    - few notied its weaknesses: its commander no seaman, ships too cumbersome, too frail, orders had to be issued in six languages, and the antagonisms between different countries had to be appeased
    - planned to sail to the Netherlands then escort the prince of Parma's army across the straits to the English coast
    - in the Channel: Sir Francis Drake as vice admiral under Lord Howard of Effingham and 200 English vessels faced the Armada
    - when it retreated, at Calis, English fireships drove it out to sea
    - "Protestant wind" blew the Armada northward into waters they couldn't sail, killing countless


### The Results of the Struggle

war continued for several years

Philip died in 1598 after a long illness

the English had assured their national independence and acquired an intense national spirit
- took to the sea with the ruin of the Armada

Netherlands:
- 1609: Twelve Years' Truce
    - partitioned the Netherlands farther north than in Parma's time, because the Spaniards had retaken Antwerp and other cities in the middle zone
    - Dutch: the seven provinces from the Union of Utrecht in 1579
        - since a third remained Catholic, they adopted a policy of toleration
    - Spanish Netherlands (Belgium): the 10 provinces south of the line
        - ruined after 40 years of war and with the Dutch  refusing to allow vessels to proceed to Antwerp or to Ghent, these cities died, giving way to Amsterdam becoming the commercial and financial center of northern Europe
- took to the sea
    - 160: Dutch East India Company organized
    - 1607: English settled in Virginia
    - 1612: Dutch settled in New York

Spain's internal decline began
- monarchs depended on the next arrival of treasure from the Indies
- production weakened by inflation, taxation, emigration, and depopulation
- the massive numbers of minor aristocrats, chevaliers, dons, and hidalgos from the Crusades were contemptuous of work, and the ablest men entered the church
- people disdained secular activities
- began hunting the Moriscos again, which included some of the best farmers and most skilled artisans in the country
    - 1609: 150,000 driven out of Valencia
    - 1610: 64,000 driven from Aragon
    - 1611: many expelled from Castile
    - Spain lost one of the most socially valuable of all its minorities
- 1640: Portugal reestablished its independence and Catalonia rose in open rebellion
    - Catalan war lasted for almost twenty years, the French supporting the rebels
- Spanish kingdoms almost as disunited as in the days of Isabella and Ferdinand


## 15. The Disintegration and Reconstruction of France
[Top](#unit-4-religious-warfare-and-state-building)

### Political and Religious Disunity

the Wars of Religion were equally religious, political, and feudal rebellion
- the New Monarcchy, resuming the work of medieval kings, united the country
    - the country acted as a unit in foreign affairs, apart from civil war
    - king alone made treaties
    - subjects fought for king
- royal centralization was largely administrative
- underneath the platform of royalty, there was little substantial unity in France
    - three hundred areas with their own legal systems
    - *bonnes villes* - like the HRE's free cities, which defended their corporate rights
    - France had provinces as great as some European kingdoms that each ahd their own identity, autonomy, laws, courts, tariffs taxes, and parliament/provincial estates
    - diversity in religion with the spread of Calvinism (Huguenots)

French Catholicism was independent from Rome and the papacy
- French clergy struggled for its Gallican liberties
- French kings deal rudely with popes, ignored the Council of Trent, and allied for political reasons with both the Lutherans and the Turks
- lay investiture

French Protestantism was extreme
- 1560/1570s: >1/3 and near 1/2 of French nobility was Protestant
    - believed in the *ius reformandi*, the right to regulate religion on their own estates
    - turned the peasants on their lands into Huguenots
    - primarily spread in southwestern France

both Francis I and Henry II opposed the spread of Calvinism because it threatened the powers of the monarchy and the idea of a nationally established church
- because of how prominent the French nobility featured, it looked like a political/feudal rebellion
- 1559: Henry II was accidentally killed in a tournament
    - 3 son, the eldest 15
    - mother was Catherine de Medici, who tried to govern the country for her royal sons
- with no firm hand in control of the monarchy, the country fell apart
- the Huguenots, under persecution, took up arms
    - they had >1/3rd of the professional warrior class, the nobles

### The Civil and Religious Wars

unorganized conflict - 9 civil wars in the concluding 4 decades of the 16th century in France

    - 1572: fearing hte growing influence of Coligny and a concourse of leading Huguenots in Paris to celebrate Henry of Navarre's marriage, at the massacre of St. Bartholomew's Day, she massacred thousands of Huguenots after midnight 
    - Coligny was killed
    - Henry of Navarre escaped by temporarily changing his religion
    - caused Huguenot fury and a renewal of civil war
- both parties hired parties of mercenary soldiers, mainly from Germany
- Spanish troops invaded at the invitation of the Guises
- Protestant towns appealed to Elizabeth of England, but she was too preoccupied
- truces acknowledging the status quo were common, but fighting often broke out in the midst of them because no side had the power to enforce them
- *politiques* - developed among the more perfunctory Catholics and moderate Protestants
    - concluded too much was being made of religion
    - secular view
    - Henry of Navarre and the political philosopher Jean Bodin (1530-1596), the first thinker to develop the modern theory of sovereignty
    - idea of royal absolutism and of the sovereign state

### The End of the Wars: Reconstruction under Henry IV

1589: both Henry III, the reigning king, and Henry of Guise, the Catholic party chief trying to depose him, were assassinated

Henry of Navarre, the Huguenot chieftain, reigned as Henry IV
- first of the Bourbon dynasty
- Catholic party refused to recognize him and the Huguenots had become an increasingly unpopular minority

- 1598: Henry IV eissued the Edict of Nantes
    - granted every seigneur the right to hold Protestant services in his own household and allowed Protestantism in towns where it was the prevailing form of worship, and in any case, in one town of each *bailliage* throughout the country
    - barred Protestantism from Catholic episcopal towns and a zone surrounding Paris
    - promised that Protestants would enjoy the same civil rights as Catholics (chance for public offices, access to Catholic universities)
    - creatied mixed chambers of both Protestants and Catholics in certain superior law courts
    - granted 100 fortified towns to be held by Protestant garrisons under Protestant demand
- Huguenots were appeased, but everyone else refused to recognize the edict

- the Estates Gerneral was never called during his reign
- Henry IV laid the foundations of royal absolutism
- assassinated in 1610 by a fanatic who believed him a meance to the Catholic church
- his widow, Marie de Medici, was forced by the upper Catholic clergy to summon the Estates General, but it was so conflicted and chaotic that Marie dismissed them in 1615 to everyone's general relief and they never met again until after the French Revolution

## 16. The Thirty Years' War, 1618-1648: The Disintegration of Germany
[Top](#unit-4-religious-warfare-and-state-building)

HRE divided evenly by religion, with no clear majority/minority

HRE was in decline in 1600
- literature delined, the language became barbarized and ungainly 
- Lutherans suspicious of the world outside Lutheran states of Germany and Scandinavia, suffered from cultural isolation
- German universities attracted fewer students and their effort was consumed in combative dogmatics
- more witches burned than in the west
- popular fairy tales more gruesome
- educated more fascinated by astrology
- commerce decaying because of the shift of trade to the Atlantic and the Dutch controlled the mouth of the Rhine
- German bankers declined

### Background of the Thirty Years' War

Germany fell apart into two parties in anticipation of a religious war
- the Peace of Augsburg in 1555 (*cuius regio eius religio*) provided that in each state the government could prescribe the religion of its subjects
- so after a ruler died, the was a race to name his successor to secure the territory as Lutheran or Catholic
- Lutherans made steady victories, Catholics indignant at this, Calvinists, despite having no rights under the Peace of Augsburg, also spread into Germany
- 1608: the Protestant states, urged by the Elector Palatine, formed a Protestant union
    - negotiated with the Dutch, English, and Henry IV of France
- 1609: a league of Catholic German states organized by Bavaria
    - sought help from Spain

foreign w3ar
- Twelve Years' Truce between Spain and the Dutch, was due to expire in 1621
- Spain wanted to crush the Dutch Republic and consolidate the Habsburg position in central Europe, to unite the Netherlands and the Franche-Comte into a large and continuous territorial block
- France hated the idea of a strong power in Germany, so France became the chief protector of Protestantism

Thirty Years' War was a result of
- German civil war fought over the Catholic-Protestant issue
- a German civil war fought over constitutional issues
    - emperor striving to build up the central power of the Empire
    - member states struggling to maintain independence
- international war
    - France vs. Habsburgs
    - Spain vs Dutch
    - kings of Denmark and Sweden and the prince of Transylvania became involved
- generals were soldiers of fortune who aspired to create principalities of their own

### The Four Phases of the War

1 - Bohemian (1618-1625)
- "defenestration of Prague": the Bohemians, fearing the loss of their Protestant liberties, threw two emissaries from the Habsburg Holy Roman Emperor, Matthias, out of the window
    - deposed him after he sent troops to restore his authority
    - elected the Calvinist Elector Palatine, the head of the Protestant Union, as their new king
    - Protestant Union, Dutch, and the prince of Transylvania sent aid
    - the Emperor Ferdinand, Matthias' successor, with money from the pope, Spanish troops from Milan, and the forces of Catholic Bavaria, overwhelmed the Bohemians at the battle of the White Mountains in 1620
    - Frederick fled
    - Spaniards overran the Palatinate 
- consequences
    - Spanish entrenching themselves in the Rhineland
    - Bohemia reconquered and revolutionized by the Habsburgs
        - Ferdinand got elected as king and confiscated the estates of almost half of the Bohemian nobles
        - granted these lands as endowments for churches, orderse, and monasteries, or gave them out to the swarm of adventurers who had entered his service
        - Jesuits streamed in
        - missions, schools, court proceedings, executions - re-Catholicization of Bohemia
        - Protestantism was also stamped out in Austria, which had at first joined Bohemia in rebellion

2 - Danish (1625-1629)
- Protestant Union dissolved in 1621
    - the king of Denmark, also the Duke of Holstein, took the lead in Protestant affairs
        - hoped to acquire a few bishoprics in Germany to construct a kingdom for his younger son
    - Ferdinand commissioned Albert of Wallenstein to raise an army, which defeated the kinng of Denmark, reached the Baltic coast, and invaded the Danish peninsula

    - 1629: Edict of Restitution: emperor declared all church territories secularized since 1552 automatically restored to the Catholic church
    - alarmed the French and the Swedes
    - Richelieu of France sent diplomats to extricate the king of Sweden from a war with Poland and promised financial assistance in exchange for 40,000 Swedish troops in Germany
    - the Dutch also subsidized the Swedes
- Gustavus Adolphus was the king of Sweden
    - conciliated all parties in Sweden
    - he had created the most modern army of the times
        - notes for its firm discipline, high courage, and mobile cannon
    - ideal role for the Protestant champion
    - landed in Germany in 1630
- Sweden won a number of spectacular victories
    - 1631: Breitenfeld
    - 1632: Lutzen
        - Gustavus Adolphus was killed; his chancellor, Oxenstierna, carried on
    - penetrated into Bohemia and the Danube
- Swedes were left isolated, both sides weakened
    - Wallenstein, disliking the Spanish influence in Germany, ceased to fight and entered into private talks with the Swedes and Saxons hoping to create an independent position for himself
        - assassinated by one of his own staff and disgraced by the emperor
    - Saxons signed the Peace of Prague of 1635 with the emperor
        - other German Protestant states concurred and withdrew support from Sweden
        - Sweden left floundering and isolated

4 - Swedish-French (1635-1648)
- Richelieu doubled down, renewing his assurances to the Swedes, paying subsidies even to the wealthy Dutch, hiring a German princeling, Bernard of Saxe-Weimar, and came out openly in favor of the German Protestants
- Spanish drove deep into France from their bases in Belgium and Franche-Comte
    - Champagne and Burgundy ravaged, Paris seized
    - Spanish also raided the south
- in response, France recognized the independence of Portugal (like England, Holland, and Sweden), and recognized a Catalan republic when Portugal and Catalonia rebelled against Philip IV
- this last phase was more of an international struggle on German soil than a civil war
- few German states sided with the French and the Swedes

### The Peace of Westphalia, 1648

Peace talks began in 1644 in Westphalia at Munster and Osnabruck
- German states crying for peace, for a final religious settlement, for reform of the HRE
- France and Sweden insisted that the German states should individually take part in negotiations
    - German princes welcomed 
    - emperor vainly resisted
- so hundreds of diplomats gathered at Westphalia, a massive secular European congress on the scale of the Council of Constance
- France and Spain refused to make peace with each other at all; negotiations dragged on

    - renewed the Peace of Augsburg, granting each German state the right to determine its own religion
    - added Calvinism as an acceptable faith
    - the Empire couldn't make laws, raise taxes, recuirt soldiers, or declare war or peace terms except with the consent of the imperial estates, the 300+ princes, ecclesiastics, and free cities in the Reichstag assembled

    - Dutch and Swiss ceased to belong to the HRE
    - the French cut off small pieces from the western frontier
    - king of Sweden received Bremen, Verden, and the western half of Pomerania
    - Brandenburg and Bavaria expanded, the empire now had eight electors
    - the 300+ German states became virtally sovereign

Germany was wrecked by the Thirty Years' War

## 17. The Grand Monarque and the Balance of Power
[Top](#unit-4-religious-warfare-and-state-building)

Louis XIV, the Grande Monarque, the Sun King
- inherited his throne in 1643 at the age of 5, assumed the personal direction of affairs in 1661 at the age of 23, and reigned for 72 years until his death in 1715
- longest ruling ruler in history
- made France the strongest country in Europe
    - used French money to build pro-French interest in virtually every country from England to Turkey
    - he and France est the peace of public events, rulers, styles of art, architecture, cooking, and etiquette

Spain - the "sick man of Europe"
- social and economic decline combined with the hereditary physical deterioration of its rulers, the product of generations of inbreeding
- Spanish Habsburg branch died with the death of Charles II, who inherited the throne from 1665 to 1700

Louis XIV, who had married a sister of Charles II, planned to use this to expand French borders
- eastward to the Rhine, annexing Spanish Netherlands (Belgium) and the Franche-Comte (Free County of Burgundy)
- hoped to obtain the entire Spanish inheritance for himself
- if he had succeeded, he would've created a universal monarchy
    - balance of power to counter this

### The Idea of Balance of Power

the idea of maintaining the equilibrium

the basic rule: ally against any state threatening domination, allying with other weaker states to create a counterweight, "restoring the balance"
- each state threw its weight where it's most needed, so that its own importance may be enhanced
- purpose was to preserve the sovereignty and independence of the states of Euorpe ("liberties of Europe"), rather than peace
- worked as well as it did because of the sheer number of states pursuing this and the fact that small states could be important military partners due to military technology

the Dutch (William III, the prince of Orange, who was later also the king of England and Scotland) engineered the balance against Louis XIV

    - 1621: founded a Dutch West India Company to exploit the riches of Spanish and Portuguese America
    - founded colonies at Pernambuco and Bahia in Brazil and at Caaracas, Curacao, and in Guiana in the Caribbean
    - 1652: captured the Cape of Good Hope in South Africa from the Portuguese
- 1609: founded the Bank of Amsterdam, which accepted mixed money and minted gold florins of known and unchanging weight and purity
    - became an internationally sought money and an international measure of value
    - Amsterdam = financial center of Europe
- the head of the house of Orange typically became the stadholder in most provinces
- nobles eclipsed by the burghers; the burghers rarely worried over military questions and hated taxes

politics was a balance between the burghers and the princes of Orange
- Peace of Westphalia produced a mood of confidence in the burghers, followed by a constitutional crisis
- William II died in 1650, no new stadholder was elected for 22 years
- 8 days after his father's death, the third William of the house of Orange was born
    - 1677: he married the king of England's niece, Mary

### Foreign Affairs: conflict with the English and French

    - provided that goods imported into England and its dependencies must be brought in English ships or in ships belonging to the country exporting the goods
- claimed sovereignty of the "narrow seas"
    - demanded the Dutch ships salute the English flag in the Channel
- 3 wars between Dutch and England from 1652 to 1674, generally indecisive

- new balance of power
    - alliance with Denmark and Brandenburg and with the Austrian and Spanish Habsburgs
- 1678: treaty of Nimwegen: peace achieved at the expense of Spain and the HRE
    - Louis XIV took the Franche-Comte and another batch of towns in Flanders
    - Dutch preserved their territory intact
- 1689: William became king of England
    - decisive balance formed against French expansion since Louis XIV's real bid for universal monarchy was yet to be made

## 19. Britain: The Puritan Revolution
[Top](#unit-4-religious-warfare-and-state-building)

England's religious civil war was fought between the more extreme/Calvinistic Protestants (Puritans) and the more moderate Protestants following the Church of England (Anglicans)
- Puritans asserted the rights of Parliament against the mounting claims of royalty in England

### England in the Seventeenth Century

1600: only 4-5 million people in England and Lowland Scotland spoke the English language
- a century and a half later, as the population began to spread, religious discontent led to emigration
- 20,000 Puritans settled in New England between 1630-1640
- same number went to Barbados and other West India islands
- same number settled in northern Ireland, driving away the native Celts ("plantation of Ulster")
    - the only government initiative
- English Catholics settled in Maryland
- Anglicans went to Virginia in the mid-century, adding to Jamestown (1607)
- after the middle century, the government began deliberately building an empire
    - conquered New York from the Dutch, Jamaica from the Spanish, and Pennsylvania and the Carolinas were established
    - all 13 colonies except Georgia were founded before 1700
    - half a million people in British North America

national culture
- national languages encroached on the international Latin
- Shakespeare and Milton

industry
- enterprising and affluent, although dwarfed by the Dutch
- larger and more productive, so not limited to just trading and seafaring
- coal mined around Newcastle 
- greatest industry: the growing of sheep and the manufacture of woolens
    - main export
- 1600: founded the East India Company to compete with the Dutch in assaulting the old Portuguese monopoly in India and East Asia
- wealthiest were the landed aristocracy and landlords, rather than merchants

### Background to the Civil War: Parliament and the Stuart Kings

in England, the old body, Parliament, won out against the king
- special because on the continent, successful governments were generally those in which kingly powers increased; when the old medieval bodies won, it typically meant political dissolution or anarchy
- but Parliament arrived at a workable form of government
- 1603: on the death of Queen Elizabeth, the son of Mary Stuart, James VI of Scotland, inherited the English crown
    - because he was a descendant of Henry VII
    - took the title James I
    - philosopher of royal absolutism; wrote *The True Law of Free Monarchy*
    - divine right of kings - kings drew their authority from God and were responsible to God alone
    - had trouble controlling Parliament because they had been restless at the end of Elizabeth's reign (but deferred because she was an aging woman and a national symbol), but James I was a foreigner (a Scot), a royal pedant ("the wisest fool in Christendom"), and he was always needed money because of the expenses from the wars with Spain
- Parliament refused to grant adequate revenue to James I and his son Charles I, who succeeded him in 1625
    - most members of Parliament were Puritans, dissatisfied with the Church of England
    - James threatened to drive Puritans out of the land
    - Charles supported the Anglican hierarchy, which, under Archbishop Laud, sought to enforce religious conformity
    - many members of Parliament were also lawyers and feared that the common law of England was in danger
    - disliked Henry VII's Star Chamber and Elizabeth's High Commission
    - practically all members of Parliament were property owners
        - feared that if the king raised taxes, their own wealth would be insecure

Parliament
- one centralized Parliament that could concentrate opposition, making it so effective
- two houses: House of Lords (predominantly secular) and the House of Commons
- landed interest dominated in both houses (noblemen in the Lords and the gentry in the Commons)

1629: Charles I attempted to rule without Parliament
- Parliament could only legally meet at the ryoyal summons
- but Charles antagonized many parties
    - through certain reforms in Ireland, he antagonized English landlords with interests in Ireland
    - by supporting the High Anglicans, he made the Puritans enemies
    - "ship money", raising funds without parliamentary consent, he alarmed property owners
        - John Hampden in 1637 - lost his lawsuit but won the sympathy of politically significant classes

Scots were the first to rebel
- 1637: rioted in Edinburgh against attempts to impose the Anglican religion in Scotland
- 1640: Charles convoked the English Parliament in an attempt to raise funds to put down the rebellion
    - first time in 11 years
    - dissolved after it proved hostile
    - called for new elections but the same men returned
    - Long Parliament: the same body of men that sat for 20 years (1640-1660) without new elections
        - leaders: John Hampden, John Pym, Oliver Cromwell, small or moderately well-to-do landowning gentry
        - merchant class lent its support
- the Long Parliament was revolutionary
    - insisted that the chief royal advisers be impeached and put to death
    - abolished Star Chamber and the High Commission
    - the "root and branch", the most extreme Calvinist element, drove through a bill for the abolition of bishops, revolutionizing the Anglican church
    - 1642: Parliament (east and south) and the king (north and west) came to open war
    - Parliament adopted the Solemn League and Covenant as a price for support from the Scottish army
        - religion in England, Scotland, and Ireland should be made uniform, so Presbyterianism became the established legal religion

### The Emergence of Cromwell 

Oliver Cromwell, a devout Puritan
- organized the Ironsides, a more effective military force that represented a more popular class than Parliament
    - favored free toleration for all "godly" forms of religion
    - no superior church organization
- Pride's Purge: (after Colonel Pride, who commanded the soldiers) with the Ironsides, Cromwell broke Parliament up (because they hesitated to depose Charles I, the defeated king)
    - left a Rump of 50-60, from Parliament's original 500 in 1640
    - 1649: the Rump put King Charles to death on the scaffold
- the British Isles declared a republic, named the Commonwealth
    - religious toleration decreed except for Unitarians and atheists and Roman Catholics and the most obstinate Anglicans
        - Protestant and Calvinist fury swept over Ireland
        - massacres of newly settled Protestants in Ulster in 1641 left bitter memories
        - Protestant landlords spread across the country, replacing Catholic landlords 
        - native Catholic religion and clergy driven underground, a foreign and detested church established, new and foreign landed aristocracy settled in the country
- success in external affairs
    - subjugation of Ireland
    - Navigation Act of 1651 against Dutch maritime supremacy
    - war with Spain to acquire Jamaica
    - English bidding for the inheritance of the Spanish Habsburgs
- failed to gain support of a majority of the English
    - too many extremists that Cromwell failed to satisfy
- Levellers: advanced political democrats
    - numerous in the Puritan army
    - chief spokesman, John Lilburne, was a civilian
    - appealed to natural rights and to the rights of Englishman
    - asked for universal manhood suffrage, equality of representation, a writtten constitution, and subordination of Parliament to a reformed body of voters
- Quakers, Society of Friends - founded by George Fox
    - rejected social amenities in the name of the Spirit
- "Diggers": occupied and cultivated common lands or privately owned lands in a general repudiation of property
- Fifth Monarchy Men: millennial group who felt that the end of the world was at hand
    - empires of Assyria, Persia, Alexander, and Caesar
    - the world would soon give way to the fifth monarchy, of Christ, in which justice would at last rule
- couldn't turn to royalist and Anglican interests; unable to agree with the Rump so he abolished it in 1653
- vainly attempted to govern under the Instrument of Government
- driven to place England under military rule, under the regime of the "major generals"
- died in 1658, and his son was unable to maintain the Protectorate
- two years later, royalty was restored, and Charles II, son of the dead Charles I, became the king of England and Scotland
- left behind a legacy of standing armies and major generals, rather than religious revolution

## 20. Britain: The Triumph of Parliament
[Top](#unit-4-religious-warfare-and-state-building)

### The Restoration, 1660-1688: The Later Stuarts

in 1660, the monarchy, the Church of England, and Parliament were all reestablished
- Charles II was more careful not to provoke Parliament and Parliament was more warmly loyal to the king than they had been before and more willing to uphold the established church
- Parliament
    - changed legal basis of land tenure, so possession of land came to resemble modern private property
    - replaced feudal dues to the king with taxation
        - aristocracy cleared their customary restrictions and obligations while supporting the state by imposing taxes on themselves
        - its reward for paying a large share of the expenses of the government is that it ran it
    - justices of the peace: drawn from the gentry of each country
        - "squirearchy"
- other classes drew less immediate advantage
    - Navigation Act of 1651 was renewed and added to, protecting the commercial, shipping, and manufacturing interests
    - landed classes otherwise unsympathetic to the business classes 
    - Dissenters (Puritan) - were excluded from town "corporations"/governing bodies, forbade any dissenting clergymen to teach school or come within five miles of an incorporated town, and prohibited all religious meetings ("conventicles")
    - middle class townspeople found it difficult / impossible to follow their preferred religion
    - Act of Settlement of 1662: decentralized the administration of the Poor Law, making each parish responsible only forr its own paupers
        - poor people condemend to remain in the parishes in which they lived
- religion
    - the national feeling was excitedly anti-Catholic
    - the king, Charles II, was personally inclined to Catholicism, and admired Louis XIV's monarchy, which he wanted to duplicate in England
- at odds with Parliament, Charles II signed the secret treaty of Dover of 1670 with Louis XIV
    - joined Louis XIV against the Dutch for 3 million livres a year during the war
    - Louis also wanted Charles to rejoin the Roman church
- religious toleration
    - "declaration of indulgence" - nonenforcement of laws against Dissenters
    - rightly feared that his real aim was to promote Roman Catholicism in England and open a Counter Reformation
    - 1673: Parliament passed the Test Act, requiring all officeholders to take communion in the Church of England
        - made it impossible for Catholics to serve in the government, army, or navy
- a strong movement developed in Parliament to exclude James by law from the throne
    - "Whigs"
    - king's supporters = Tories

### The Revolution of 1688

James II became king in 1685
- soon antagonized both Tories and Whigs by ignoring the Test Act, claiming the right to suspend its operation in individual cases and appointing Catholics to influential and lucrative posiitons
- when in 1688, his son was born and batized into Catholicism, it opened up the prospect of an indefinite line of Catholic rulers in England
- both parties abandoned James II and offered the throne to his daughter, Mary, brought up a Protestant, the wife of William of Orange
- William's chief interest in England towas to bring them into his balance of power against France
    - immutably Dutch and only cared about Dutch interests
- William invaded England with an army; James II fled
- 1690: at Boyne River in Ireland, an army of dutchmen, Germans, Scots, and French Huguenots under William III defeated a French and Irish force led by James II, and he fled to France
- Louis XIV refused to acknowledge his enemy as ruler of England, elevating the stakes of the French wars to the Revolution of 1688 and the return of royal absolutism in England

1689: Parliament enacted a Bill of Rights
- no law could be suspended by the king, no taxes raised or army maintained except by parliamentary consent, and no subject arrested and detained without legal process
- Act of Settlemtn of 1701: no Catholic could be king of England except the descendants of James II, the Pretenders
- Toleration Act of 1689: allowed Protestant dissenteres to practice their religion but still excluded them from political life and public service
- stopped any serious trouble over religion since ways of evading these restrictions were found

1707: the United Kingdom of Great Britain created
- English bribed Scots with economic advantages
    - rights in the English East India Company, English colonies, and the English system of mercantilism and the Navigation Acts
- Scots retained their own legal system and established Presbyterian church
- government and parliament merged with England

Ireland
- English feared Ireland as a source of danger
- "penal code" - alien church, absentee landlordism, heavy restrictions against the Catholics of Ireland as well as against the Protestant Irish
- purpose was to weaken Ireland as a potentially hostile country and to economically favor Engilsh manufacturers by removing Irish competition
- and to confirm the position of anglican interest

England joined William III's coalition against France
- brought a considerable naval force and wealth
- William's government borrowed 1,200,000 pounds from a syndicate of private lenders (1694: thus originated the Bank of England and the British national debt)

1688: the Glorious Revolution
- England became a true aristocracy; the landowning interest was the only class sufficiently wealthy, numerous, educated, and self-conscious to stand on its own feet

## 21. The France of Louis XIV, 1643-1715: The Triumph of Absolutism
[Top](#unit-4-religious-warfare-and-state-building)

### French Civilization in the Seventeenth Century

1700: France had 19 million inhabitants, over 3x as populous as England and over 2x as populous as Spain
- fertile soil made it wealthy
- millions lived in poverty, but at the same time, millions lived lived in comfortable or luxurious circumstances
- the sheer number of people dwarfed every other country, even in declining populations
- it also became the forefront of civilization: French langauge, thought, and culture swept through Europe

### The Development of Absolutism in France

tradition of political freedom in the feudal sense
- Estates General that had not met since 1615 but was not legally abolished
- in some regions, Provincial Estates still met frequently
- over a dozen parlements - courts of law, a supreme court for a certain area of the country
    - refused royal edicts when declared constitutional
    - upheld certain "fundamental laws" which the king couldn't overstep
- 300 "customs" / regional systems of laws
- taxation was variable
- France was a bundle of territories held together by allegiance to the king

Fronde
- broke out immediately after the Peace of Westphalia, while Louis XIV was still a child
- directed against Cardinal Mazarin, who was governing in his name
- led by the parlements and the nobility
- insisted in 1648 on their right to pronounce certain edicts unconstitutional
- barricades thrown up, street fighting broke out in Paris, nobility rebelled, leadership assumed by prominent noblemen
- nobility demanded a calling of the Estates General
- armed bands of soldiers terrorized peasants
- rebellious nobles called in Spanish troops despite them being at war
- failed because the bourgeoisie and the aristocracy couldn't work togheter and because the nobles outraged the loyalty of many Frenchman by joining with Spain and because the *frondeurs*, after the parlements deserted them, had no systematic or constructive program
    - only planned on overthrowing Cardinal Mazarin and obtain offices and favors for themselves

after the Fronde and religious wars, the bourgeoisie and peasnantry welcomed kings' exercise of power
- Louis XIV declared he would govern the country himself after Mazarin's death in 1661
- *L'etat, c'est moi* - no way of consolidating the powers of state except in a single man
- absolutism: the idea that law and force should be monopolized by the lawful king
- royal power was absolute but not arbitrary, because it had to conform to the higher law of the will of God

### Government and Administration

armed forces were usually private enterprises
- specialists in fighting, leading their own troops, worked for governments as they chose, in returned for money or for their own political aims
- hard for governments to set armies into motion and hard to stop them
- war easily degenerated into an aimless and perpetual violence
- Louis XIV made war an activity of state
    - all armed persons in France fought only for him
    - created a strong unity of control
    - put the artillery organically into the army
    - systematized the military ranks and grades
    - clarified the chain of command, with himself at the top
    - government supervised recruiting
    - higher officers became dependent on the government
    - soldiers became more susceptible to discipline and control
    - increased army from 100,000 to 400,000
    - possible because of the growth of a large civilian administration

Versailles
- Louis XIV built himself a city and a palace at Versailles about 10 miles from Paris
- where the Esocorial had the atmosphere of a monastery, Versailles was a monument to worldly splendor
- most of the building used for government offices
- the most exclusive honors reserved for the higher aristocrats
- many great lords were induced to live habitually at court under the royal eye, keeping them away from real political mischief
- weakened French aristocracy

Louis XIV preferred to use men whose upper-class status was recent
- no independent political influence of their own

never called the Estates General, although he allowed some of the Provincial Estates to remain functioning, and he temporarily destroyed the independence of the parlements

administrative coordination
- number of councils of state
- "intendants" - represented these councils throughout the country
- genrally were bourgeois or newly ennobled
- firm uniform administration

### Economic and Financial Policies: Colbert

king needed money
- taxes difficuilt to raise because the king could only raise taxes without consent only if he refrained from taxing the nobles, and taxes passed through too many hands before reaching the state
- Louis tried 
    - raising tax rates, although with disappointing results
    - devalued currency
    - sold patents of nobility to ambitious bourgeois
    - sold government offices, judgeships, and commissions in the army and navy
    - annuled town charters and sold back reduced rights at a price, demoralizing local government and civic spirit
- problem arose as a weakness of absolutism, because the government couldn't share its rule with the propertied classes

aspired to make France economically powerful, which his great minister, Colbert, worked for 20 years on
- couldn't do much for agriculture, which remained less developed than in England and the Netherlands
- reduced internal tariffs in a large part of Central France ("Five Great Farms")
- launched Commercial Code - replacing much of local customary law
- improved communications by building roads and canals
- worked with guilds, requiring goods of a certain kind of quality
- gave subsidies, tax exemptions, and monopolies to expand the manufacture of silks, tapestries, glassware, and woolens
- founded colonies
- built up the navy
- established French East India company
- export was encouraged to bring money into the country
- growth of the army stimulated economy
- trade and manufacture developed under more direct government guidance than in England

inconsistency between
- the royal government worked to restrict the privileges of provinces, nobles, and otheres
- but it also multiplied and protected these in its perpetual need for money

### Religion: The Revocation of the Edict of Nantes, 1985

Louis XIV backed the claims of the Gallican church to enjoy a national independence from Rome

France in the early years of his reign allowed more religious toleration than any other large state in Europe
- Huguenots lived in relative security and contentment under the Edict of Nantes

Louis XIV resented the presence of heretics in his subjects
- considered religious unity necessary to the strength and dignity of his rule
- fell under influence of Catholic advisors 
- systematic conversion of the Huguenots began, and life for Protestant families was made unbearable

1685: Louis revoked the Edict of Nantes

during the persecution, many Protestants left France, migrating to Holland, Germany, and America, which was a blow to French economic life

## 22. The Wars of Louis XIV: The Peace of Utrecht, 1713
[Top](#unit-4-religious-warfare-and-state-building)

### Before 1700

France vs the Habsburgs
- the Austrian branch ahd been checkmated at the Peace of Westphalia
- the Spanish branch remained at war with France for another decade, until the Peace of the Pyrenees in 1659
- when Louis XIV assumed personal rule, Spanish territories still faced France on three sides, but Spain was so weakened that it was less of a threat and more of a temptation for expansion
- the dream of a frontier on the Rhine and the Alps was captivating to Frenchman

1667: War of Devolution
- Louis XIV blocked by a Triple Alliance engineered by the Dutch

1672: Dutch War
- in alliance with Charles II of England
- invaded Dutch provinces on the lower rhine
- raised up his great adversary, prince of Orange, William III, who brought the Austrian and Spanish Habsburgs, Brandenburg, and Denmark into alliance with the Dutch Republic
- forced Louis to sign the treaty of Nimwegen in 1678

French gave up on Holland ambitions but took the rich province of Franche-Comte and brought French power to the borders of Switzerland

1679: Louis infiltrated the dissolving frontier of the HRE in Lorraine and Alsace
- set up *chambres de reunion* - law courts in which French judges examined the claims to various parcels of territory and pronounced in favor of the king of France
- by the Peace of Westphalia, the French king had unspecified rights in this region

1681: French troops occupied Strasbourg, which, as a free city of the HRE, regarded itself as an independent republic
- a protest went up through Germany
- but since Louis XIV had an ally in the Elector of Brandenburg and the electors of the Rhineland church-states (Cologne, Trier, and Mainz) received subsidies from the French king, the diet of the HRE was divided between an anti-French and a pro-French party
- the emperor, Leopold I, was distracted by developments in the East by the Hungarians, incited and financed by Luois XIV
- they appealed to the Turks
- 1683: Turks moved up the Danube and besieged Vienna 
- Louis XIV declined to join the proposed crusade against them

returning to the Western front, Emperor Leopold gathered the Catholic powers against the French

at the same time, the Protestant states (aroused by the revocation of the Edict of Nantes in 1685 and by migrant Huguenots), allied with William of Orange

1686: League of Augsburg
- enemies of Louis XIV came together
- comprised of the Holy Roman Emperor, the kings of Spain and Sweden, the electors of Bavaria, Saxony, and the Palatinate, and the Dutch Republic
- 3 years later, when William became the king in England, England also joined hte League

1688: The War of the League of Augsburg broke out
- Louis XIV found himself badly strained (first time he imposed direct taxes on French nobles)
- 1697: Peace of Ryswick 

### The War of the Spanish Succession

1702-1713: War of Spanish Succession, eleven years
- less destructive than the Thirty Years' War because armies were more orderly and disciplined
- civilians generally spared except for civil war in Spain and starvation in France
- first war in religion counted for so little, where commerce and sea power were the principal stakes, and the first "world war"

two main apsirants to the Spanish inheritance
- king of France
- Holy Roman Emperor
- each married a sister of Charles II and who could place a younger member of their family on the throne of Spain
- they had made treaties to partition Spanish possessions, but when Charles II finally died in 1700, it was found that he had made a will stipulating that Spain should be kept intact 
    - all Spanish territories should go to the grandson of Louis XIV
    - if he refused, they would go to the son of the HAbsburg emperor in Vienna

William III gathered the stunned and hesitant diplomats into the Grand Alliance of 1701
- William died the next year, before hostilities began
- Grand Alliance included England, Holland, and the emperor, supported by Brandenburg, Portugal, and the Italian duchy of Savoy

Louis XIV's only ally was Spain, which was loyal to the late king's will, and Bavaria because of its rivalry with Austria

the Allies won notable battles at
- Blenheim in Bavaria (1704)
- Ramillies (1706)
- Oudenarde (1708)
- Malplaquet (1709)

Louis XIV asked for peace but wouldn't agree to it because Allied terms were so enormous
- fought to hold the two crowns, to conquer Belgium, to get French merchants into Spanish America, and at the worst in self-defense
- after minor successes in 1710, he again insisted on controlling the crown of Spain

Spain fought to uphold Spanish unity and integrity
- because England moved in at Gibraltar and made a treaty with Portugal and the Austrians landed at Barcelona and invaded Catalonia, which again rose in rebellion, Spain fell into civil war

Austrians fought to keep Spain in the Habsburg family, to crush Bavaria, and to carry Austrian influence across the Alps into Italy

Dutch fought for their security, to keep the French out of Belgium, and to close the river Scheldt

English fought for these same reasons and to keep the French-supported Catholic Stuarts out of England and to preserve the Revolution of 1688

Brandenburg and Savoy had entered the alliance to gain possible advantages

### The Peace of Utrecht

1713: treaty of Utrecht
- the Whigs thought the treaty insufficiently favorable to England, so Queen Anne raised twelve Tory commoners to the peerage to give a Tory majority in the Lords and hence obtain ratification of the treaty
- set a precedent of creating enough new Lords of appropriate views to get a fundamental majority in that House
- the treaty partitioned the world of Spain
    - British remained at Gibraltar and annexed the island of Minorca
    - Duke of Savoy granted Sardinia
    - Milan, Naples, and Sicily, as well as the Spanish Netherlands (Belgium) were passed to the Austiran Habsburgs
    - Spanish Guelderland in the Spanish Netherlands was handed over to the Elector of Brandenburg
    - the grandson of Louis XIV was confirmed king (Philip V of Spain) 
        - stipulation that the French and Spanish thrones should never be inherited by the same person

1714: Treaty of Rastadt

the war was the fundamental cause of French loss of strength
- produced poverty, misery, and depopulation
- exposed Louis XIV to severe criticism
- revival of aristocratic and parliamentary opposition
- by the treaties, they abandoned their efforts to conquer Belgium and ceased to recognize the Stuart pretender as king of Great Britain
- surrendered to the British Newfoundland and Nova Scotia (Acadia) and recognized British sovereignty in the disputed American northwest (Hudson Bay territory)
- retained conquests of Louis XIV in Alsace and the Franche-Comte, strong influence in Spain

Dutch received guarantee of safety (right to garrison the "Dutch Barrier" in Belgium) and gave them freedom from competition, with Belgium transferred to Austria

Great Britain made its appearance as a great power (now in the Mediterranean)
- the dangerous province, Belgium, was in the innocuous hands of the Austrians at GB and Holland's agreement
- *asiento* extorted from Spain - the privilege of providing Spanish America with African slaves
- British merchants era of smuggling into Spanish America, competing with the French
- assured themselves a line of Protestant kings and of the maintenance of constitutional and parliamentary government
