## Unit 6: French Revolution & Napoleon

## 41. Backgrounds

### The Old Regime: The Three Estates

First: clergy
Second: nobility
Third: everyone else, from the wealthiest business and professional classes to the poorest peasantry and city workers

overexaggeration of importance of conditions of the church + position of the clergy as a cause of the French revolution
- French bishoprics not that much wealthier
- <= 100k Catholic clergy in the entire population

but the church was still deeply involved in the prevailing social system

### The Agrarian System of the Old Regime

>4/5 of the people were rural

manor retained certain surviving features of the feudal age 
- hunting rights
- banalit√©s
- vestigial powers of jurisdiction in the manorial court and certain local polic powers
- seigneurial privileges

The Revolution revolutionized the law of property by freeing the private ownership of land from 
- manorial fees
- eminent property rights
- communal village agricultural practices
- church tithes
and to abolish other older forms of property
- in public office or in mastership in the guilds
established the institutions of private property in the modern sense
- benefited most the landowning peasants and bourgeoisie


political unity was a prerequisite for the Revolution
- it only existed in the French state

## 42. The Revolution and Reorganization of France

### The Financial Crisis

financial collapse of the government
- only 5% of public expenditures in 1788 was devoted to the upkeep of the entire royal establishment
- the rest was war costs
	- current upkeep of armies and navies (1/4 of public expenditures)
	- burden of public debt from war costs of the past (1/2 of public expenditures)
- debt of almost 4 billion livres

lacking revenue
- the taille, the most important tax, was generally paid only by the peasants
	- nobles exempt by class privilege
	- bourgeois + office holders = special exemptions
- church insisted that its property was not taxable by the state
	- periodic "free gift" was not as substantial

taxing the privileged classes:
- Louis XIV, John Law, Maupeou, Turgot, had all seen the need
- Jacques Necker, a Swiss banker made director of the finances in 1777 by Louis XVI made moves in the same direction and was dismissed
- his successor, Calonne, proposed a more radical program
	- a modest resort to representative institutions
	- a general tax on all landowners without exemption in place of the taille
	- convened an "assembly of notables", hoping to win endorsement of his ideas
- a deadlock followed; the king dismissed Calone and appointed his successor Lomenie de Brienne, the archbishop of Toulouse
	- tried to push the same program through the Parlement of Paris
	- Parlement rejected, declaring that an Estates General needed to be assembled
- Louis XVI and Brienne resisted calling one b/c they thought it would be dominated by the nobility, and instead wanteed to replace the law courts with a modernized judicial system
	- led to a revolt of the nobles, the government grinding to a halt
	- July 5, 1788: Louis XVI promised to call the Estates General for the following May

### From Estates General to National Assembly

September 1788: the Parlement of Paris ruled that the Estates General should meet and vote as in 1614 in 3 separate orders
- nobility had forced the summoning of the Estates General; in this way, the French nobility initiated the Revolution
- aristocratic resurgence against the absolutism of the king
- liberal program: demanded
	- constitutional government
	- guarantees of peresonal liberty for all
	- freedom of speech and press
	- freedom from arbitrary arrest and confinement
- were prepared to give up special privileges in taxation, in return hoping to become the preponderant political element in the state
- since in the clergy, the higher officers were nobles, so the nobles would have 2 chambers and the Third Estate would have 1
