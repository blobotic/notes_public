## Unit 6: French Revolution & Napoleon

## 41. Backgrounds

### The Old Regime: The Three Estates

First: clergy
Second: nobility
Third: everyone else, from the wealthiest business and professional classes to the poorest peasantry and city workers

overexaggeration of importance of conditions of the church + position of the clergy as a cause of the French revolution
- French bishoprics not that much wealthier
- <= 100k Catholic clergy in the entire population

but the church was still deeply involved in the prevailing social system

### The Agrarian System of the Old Regime

.>4/5 of the people were rural

manor retained certain surviving features of the feudal age 
- hunting rights
- banalitÃ©s
- vestigial powers of jurisdiction in the manorial court and certain local polic powers
- seigneurial privileges

The Revolution revolutionized the law of property by freeing the private ownership of land from 
- manorial fees
- eminent property rights
- communal village agricultural practices
- church tithes
and to abolish other older forms of property
- in public office or in mastership in the guilds
established the institutions of private property in the modern sense
- benefited most the landowning peasants and bourgeoisie


political unity was a prerequisite for the Revolution
- it only existed in the French state

## 42. The Revolution and Reorganization of France

### The Financial Crisis

financial collapse of the government
- only 5% of public expenditures in 1788 was devoted to the upkeep of the entire royal establishment
- the rest was war costs
	- current upkeep of armies and navies (1/4 of public expenditures)
	- burden of public debt from war costs of the past (1/2 of public expenditures)
- debt of almost 4 billion livres

lacking revenue
- the taille, the most important tax, was generally paid only by the peasants
	- nobles exempt by class privilege
	- bourgeois + office holders = special exemptions
- church insisted that its property was not taxable by the state
	- periodic "free gift" was not as substantial

taxing the privileged classes:
- Louis XIV, John Law, Maupeou, Turgot, had all seen the need
- Jacques Necker, a Swiss banker made director of the finances in 1777 by Louis XVI made moves in the same direction and was dismissed
- his successor, Calonne, proposed a more radical program
	- a modest resort to representative institutions
	- a general tax on all landowners without exemption in place of the taille
	- convened an "assembly of notables", hoping to win endorsement of his ideas
- a deadlock followed; the king dismissed Calone and appointed his successor Lomenie de Brienne, the archbishop of Toulouse
	- tried to push the same program through the Parlement of Paris
	- Parlement rejected, declaring that an Estates General needed to be assembled
- Louis XVI and Brienne resisted calling one b/c they thought it would be dominated by the nobility, and instead wanteed to replace the law courts with a modernized judicial system
	- led to a revolt of the nobles, the government grinding to a halt
	- July 5, 1788: Louis XVI promised to call the Estates General for the following May

### From Estates General to National Assembly

September 1788: the Parlement of Paris ruled that the Estates General should meet and vote as in 1614 in 3 separate orders
- nobility had forced the summoning of the Estates General; in this way, the French nobility initiated the Revolution
- aristocratic resurgence against the absolutism of the king
- liberal program: demanded
	- constitutional government
	- guarantees of peresonal liberty for all
	- freedom of speech and press
	- freedom from arbitrary arrest and confinement
- were prepared to give up special privileges in taxation, in return hoping to become the preponderant political element in the state
- since in the clergy, the higher officers were nobles, so the nobles would have 2 chambers and the Third Estate would have one
- Third Estate: declared nobility was a useless caste that could be abolished without loss, stirred by ideas of the Enlightenment and Rosseau's Social Contract
- class antagonism made peaceful reform impossible and threw many bourgeois into a radical and destructive mood

Estates General met at Versailles (May 1789)
- Third Estate boycotted and insisted that all three orders should sit as a single house and vote as individuals
- 6 weeks: deadlock
- June 13: a few priests from the First Estate sat with the Third
- June 17: Third Estate declared itself the "National Assembly"

Tennis Court Oath (June 20, 1789)
- Louis XVI under the pressure of the nobles closed the hall
- the members found a tennis court and affirmed that the National Assembly was in existence and they would not disband until they had drafted a constitution
- revolutionary b/c it assumed sovereign power for a body of men who had no legal authority
- king scrambled to present his own reforming program; the National Assembly refused to back down
- in response, the king summoned 18k soldiers to Versailles at the end of June

king of France chose the nobles over the commoners, despite it being traditional for the king to oppose feudalism (so the monarchy drew power from the bourgeoisie)
- failed to take advantage of the loyalty felt by the bourgeoisie and common people

## The Lower Classes in Action

bad conditions
- poor harvest of 1788, price of bread higher than ever
- 1789: depression; rapid growth of trade since the American war suddenly halted, wages fell, unemployment spread, scarcity drove food prices up
- labor trouble broke out (riots)
- disorder in rural districts (not paying taxes, increased vagrants, etc)

Storming of the Bastille (July 14 1789)
- had been built in the Middle Ages to overawe the city; used as a place of detention for people with enough influence to escape the common jails; governor had placed cannons in the embrasures
- people requested him to remove his cannon and to furnish them with arms; he refused
- crowd assaulted the fortress; governor surrendered
- 98 mob members died
- in rage, they streamed in and murdered 6 soldiers + the governor + a few other officials
- unintentionally saved the Assembly at Versailles; king recognized a citizens' committee

Great Fear of 1789
- insecurity in rural districts rose to panic
- general agrarian insurrection; peasants gathered to destroy the manorial regime

## The Initial Reforms of the National Assembly

"night of August 4"
- a few liberal noblemen surrendered their hunting rights, banalites, rights in manorial courts, and feudal and seigneurial privileges
- serfdom + all personal servitudes was declared ended
- tithes abolished
- others repudiated special privileges of their provinces and personal tax privileges were given up
- eminent property dues abolished, but compensation was to be paid by the peasants to former owners (most never paid and in 1793, this provision was repealed)
- French peasant landowners rid themselves of manorial obligations w/o cost to themselves
- "feudalism is abolished" 

Declaration of the Rights of Man and Citizens (August 26, 1789)
- rule of law, equal citizenship, collective sovereignty of the people; freedom of thought and religion guaranteed, no one arrested or punished except by process of law, etc
- international effects:
	- Thomas Paine, *The Rights of Man* (1791) to defend the French Revolution, impact in English
	- "rights of men" = motto

Olympe de Gouges - *The Rights of Woman* (1791)
- because the revolutionaries didn't grant equal exercise of legal rights to women
	- few argued for legal equality between the sexes

Mary Wollstonecraft in England - *Vindication of the Rights of Woman* (1792)

division between the revolutionary leadership and planning for a new government
- strong veto power for king and a legislative body in two houses (like England) vs ("patriots") delaying veto for the king and a legislative body of one chamber
	- suspicion of aristocracy
	- latter ultimately won out
- National Assembly moved to Paris (watched Louis XVI)
- more conservative revolutionaries, disillusioned at seeing these questions settled by mobs, started dropping out of the Assembly
- counterrevolution gathered strength

revolutionaries began organizing in clubs: Society of Friends of the Constitution (Jacobin club, met in an old Jacobin monastery in Paris)
- high dues restricted it to only substantial bourgeois, later lowered but not that much
- used as a caucus in which to discuss policies and lay plans
- and other lesser clubs

## Constitutional Changes

destroyed everything from the Old Regime for the hope of equal citizenship under national sovereignty
- divided France into 83 equal "departments", local officials elected locally, country decentralized administratively, in reaction against the bureaucracy of the Old Regime

Constitution of 1791 + sovereign power enacted by a unicameral elected Legislative Assembly, king given a suspensive veto power, executive power branch = weak

"flight to Varennes" (June 1791)
- Louis XIV attempted to escape from thek ingdom, join with the emigre noblemen, and seek help from foreign powers
- arrested and forced to become a constitutional monarch
- made it impossible to create a strong executive power

distinguished between active and passive citizens
- active citizens chose electors (1 per 100 active citizens) who convened in their new department and chose deputies to the national legislature and certain local offiicals
	- active = males > 25 yo, well off enough to pay a small direct tax
	- higher tax = qualified as electors, > 1/2 of adult males qualified
	- main barrier = enoug education, interset, and leisure to attend an electoral assembly a distance for home for several days

## Economic Policies

revolutionary leaders never disowned the debt of the Old Regime

confiscated all the property of the church

issued negotiable instruments called assignats, eventually becoming currency and issued in small bills
- could be used to buy former church lands

favored free economic individualism (Adam Smith's *Wealth of Nations*)
- organized speical interests were bad for society
- free market yay
- abolished guilds

after a wave of strikes, the Assembly restated the abolition of the guilds and forbade the organization of speecial economic interests of any kind

all trades free for all to enter (LE Chapelier law)

all wages settled privately by workman and employer

## The Quarrel with the Church

members of Constituent Assembly viewed church as a form of public authority and as such subordinate to sovereign power

the village priests who had made the revolt possible fou their churches and schools now confiscated as national property

Civil Constitution of the Clergy of 1790 
- set up a French national church, parish priests + bishops elected, clergy receive salary from the state, prohbiited taking of reilgious vows, etc
- French bishops only willing to accept if they could produce it on their own authority; the Assembly refused and brought it to the pope; the pope refused and denoued the Revolution itself
- in retort, the Constituent Assembly required all French clergy to swear an oath of loyalty to the constitution and the Civil Constitution of the Clergy
- half took the oaht and half refused (including all but 7 of the bishops)

now two churches: 
- clandestine (voluntary offerings or funds smuggled in from abroad)
	- "refractory" clergy, violently counterrevolutionary, denounced official church as schismatics who spurned the pope and as careerists
- official (financed by government)
	- "constitutional" clergy
	- considered themselves patriots and defenders of the rights of man

most people (king, aristocrats, peasants now uninterested in the Revolution) sought the refractory clergy to save their immortal souls

Civil Constitution of the clergy = greatest tactical blunder of the Revolution
- destroyed Galician privilege

# 43. The Revolution and Europe: The War and the "Second" Revolution, 1792

## The International Impact of the Revolution

doctrines of the French Revolution were easily exportable, and many excluded classes were inspired
- the you were aroused
- sense of a new era

anti-Revolutionary movement + government increasingly fearing pro-French/revolutionary elements
- Edmund Burke, 1790, *Reflections on the Revolution in France*

## The Coming of the War, April 1792

Declaration of Pillnitz (August 1791)
- Leopold would take military steps to restore order in France if all the other powers would join him
- believed with William Pitt's attitude (British prime minister), the if would never materialize
- French emigres used it as an open threat 
- the Revolutionaries in France didn't realize what Leopold meant and took these menaces at face value
- gave political advantage to the Jacobins (party of international revolution)

they wanted war in which French armies enter neighboring couries, unite with local revolutionareies, and overthrow established governments
- set up a government of republics

Lafayette: favor war because they thought that war might restore the popularity of Louis XVI, unite the country under the new government, and put down the Jacobin agitation

Leopold II died, his successor, Francis II, resumed negotiations for war

April 20, 1792, the Assembly declared war on the "king of Hungary and Bohemia" = Austrian monarchy

## The "Second" Revolution: August 10, 1792

peasants and urban workers felt that their interests were slighted; prices soared, gold had been taken out by the emigres, and the assignats were quickly losing value
- they rallied to the Revolution but not to the revolutionary government

first war went unfavorably: Prussia joined with Austria, and by summer 1792 they were on the point of invading France

Brunswick Manifesto of July 25, 1792
- if any harm befell the French king and queen the Austro-Prussian forces would exact the most severe retribution on the inhabitants of Paris

it roused the French masses, and they turned against the king because he was identified with the powers they were at war with

a revolutionary municipal government ("Commune") was set up in Paris
- usurped powers of Legislative Assembly
- abolished constitution
- forced election by universal male suffrage of a Constitutional Convention to govern France and prepare a new and more democratic constitution
	- recollection of the american Constitutional Convention in 1787

September massacres
- insurrectionary volunteers killed 1.1k refractory priests and other counterrevolutionaries from the prisons 

# 44. The Emergency Republic, 1792-1795: The Terror

## The National Convention

National Convention met (Spetember 20, 1792)
- sit for three years
- immediately proclaimed Year One of the French Republic
- on the same day: won a moral victory in the cannonade of Valmy
	- Prussian commander stopped marching to Paris
- French soon occupied Belgium, Savoy, and Mainz
- decreed assistance to everyone wanting to recover their liberty

new most advanced revolutionary group: "<ountain"
- mostly of provincial birth
- representatives of the city of Paris
- "sans-culottes" - worked workingman's long trousers instead of the culottes of the middle/upper classes
- working class
- demanded meaningful equality
- denoued the now deposed king and queen for collusion with Austria
- feared Convention might be too moderate
- favored direct democracy

Convention put Louis XVI on trial for treason (December 1792)
- January 15 1793: unanimously pronoued him guilty
- next day: only 361/721 voted for immediate execution; he died on guillotine
- moderates = "Girdonins" = counterrevolutionaries
