# 84. The Russo-Japanese War and Its Consequences

Conflict:
- Japan needed to supply their new factories with raw materials and markets on the Asian mainland, for employment for their newly westernized army and navy, and for recognized status as a Great Power in the Western sense
- Russia needed an atmosphere of crisis and expansion to stifle criticism of tsarism at home, couldn't abide the presence of a strong power on its East Asian frontier, could use Manchuria and Korea to strengthen the exposed outpost of Vladivostok
- China's concession to Russia: build the Chinese Eastern Railway to Vladivostok across the heart of MAnchuria
- 1902: Japan signed a military alliance with GB
	- GB alarmed by diplomatic isolation after Fashoda and the Boer War, and how they had been expecting war with Russia in the Far East/Middle East/Near East
1904: Japanese naval attack on Port Arthur
- battle of Mukden: 624,000 soldiers, largest battle in history up to that point
- Russian Baltic fleet met and destroyed at Tsushima Strait by the new and untested Japanese navy
- Russia communications by sea broken
- Japan won the battle of Mukden
- Russia defeated

Treaty of Portsmouth in 1905:
- Theodore Roosevelt stepped in to mediate at Portsmouth, New Hampshire
- Japan recovered from Russia what it had won and lost in 1895
	- Port Arthur, Liaotung peninsula, a preferred position in Manchuria, and a protectorate in Korea (later annexed by Japan), and the southern half of Sakhlain
	- most of this was regained later after the Second World War

significance:
- first war between Great Powers since 1870
- first war fought under the conditions of developed industrialism
- first war between westernized powers caused by competition over exploitation of undeveloped countries
- first time a non-European power had defeated a European power in modern times
- Russian government shifted attention back to Europe and the Balkans (resulting in WWI)
- weakened tsarist government and garnered public disgust over government's incompetency, leading to the Revolution of 1905, which then led to the Russian Revolution of 1917 (leading to Soviet communism)
- inspired non-Europeans—they concluded that they needed to westernize
	- nationalist revolutions began
		- 1905: Persia
		- 1908: Turkey
		- 1911: China
		- 1909: British admitted an Indian to the Viceroy's executive Council
		- 1916: Dutch created a People's Council including Indonesian members
	- aka the Revolt of Asia
- tl;dr: put an end to Europe's world supremacy and European civilization as they knew it

# 91. Backgrounds

## Russia after 1881: Reaction and Progress

1881: Alexander II assassinated by members of the People's Will
- his son,. Alexander III (1881-1894) tried to stamp out revolutionism and to silence all criticism of the government
- empire adopted a program of systematic Russification for the first time

Russia became more than ever a part of European civilizaition in the closing decades of the 19th century
- Russian novels (Tolstoy, Turgenev, Dostoevski)
- music (Tchaikovsky, Rimsky-Korsakov)
- Industrial Revolution: European capital financed railways, mines, and factories
- Russia adapted the gold standard in 1897 under the reofrming ministry of Count Witte
- industrialization increased the numbers of the bourgeoisie and the proleteriat
	- unions and strikes were prohibited, but great strikes in the 1890s called attention to their misery
	- unique feature: Russian industry heavily concentrated, so it was easier for workers to be organized economically and at the right time to be mobilized politically
	- Russian bourgeoisie was weaker because ownership of most industry was in foreign hands and Russia already had the largest state-operated economic system in the world; government was also less dependent financially on its own people and could maintain an absolutist regime because it borrowed heavily from Europe
- 1905: Constitutional Democratic party ("Cadets") was formed
- Russia became predominantly agricultural (peasants paid high taxes and under these pressures, the peasants were forever demanding more land ("lang hunger"))

## The Emergence of Revolutionary Parties

two traditional sources of revolutionary disturbance:
- peasants demanded rights in all the land of former estates on which they had formerly been serfs, not merely the portion that had been allotted to peasnat possession after the Emancipation
	- unappeasable land hunger, deathly jealous of the landed class
- revolutionary intelligentsia: by 1890, they had moved on from terrorism and nihilism and discussed instead where they could find an army 
	- most were "populists", believing that a great native revolutionary tradition existed in Russia, following the likes of Pugachev's rebellion in 1773
	- admired the *mir*, the Russian communal village
	- respected Marx and Engels but didn't believe that an urban proletariat was the only true revolutionary class, nor did they believe that the horrors of capitalism had to precede socialism, believing Russia could skip it
	- 1883: two populists, plekhanov and Axelrod, converted to Marxism after fleeing to Switzerland and in 1883 founded the Russian Social Democratic / Marxist party in exile
	- Lenin then became the father of communism, spending his years in exile in western Europe until 1917
	- 1898: the Marxists in Russia, spurred by émigrés, founded the Social Democratic Labor party (not more revolutionary than the larger group of Social Revolutionaries, just had a different conception of the revolution and international movement, partially because many of them lived in Europe in exile)

## Split in the Social Democrats: Bolsheviks and Mensheviks

1903: Russian Marxists held a second party congress in Brussels and London to unify all Russian Marxism
- split it into the Bolshevik (majority) and Menshevik (minority) factions
- Lenin was the main author of the split and the founder of Bolshevism, although it was usually the Mensheviks that had the majority
- 1912: the Bolshevik wing organized itself as a separate party
- Bolshevism = "hards", attracted to Lenin - believed that the party should be a small revolutionary elite
	- strongly centralized party without autonomy for national or other component groups
	- thought the party would strengthen itself through purges
	- stood for the rigid reaffirmation of Marxian fundamentals (irreconciliable class struggle and dialectical materialism)
- Mensheviks = "softs", repelled by Lenin - wanted a larger and more open party with membership for sympathizers
	- favored bridging all but the most fundamental disagreements
	- recommended cooperation with the liberals, progressives, and bourgeois dmeocrats
	- resembled Marxists of western Europe

Marxist-Leninism:
- imperialism was exclusivley a product of monopoly capitalism, i.e. capitalism in its big business, "highest", and "final" stage
- denounced all who attempted to "add" anything to Marx's fundamental principles
- above all: Lenin developed Marx's idea of the role of the party
- while it didn't contribute much in theory, it contributed much to the movement because Lenin was an activist
- merged Russian revolutionary traditions with the Western doctrine of Marxism

# 92. The Revolution of 1905

## Background and Revolutionary Events

the Constitutional Democratic, Social Revolutionary, and Social Democratic parties were yet to be parties in a Western sense, instead they were propaganda agencies

government refused to make any concessions
- Nicholas II: regarded all ideas questioning autocracy, Orthodoxy, and Great Russian nationalism as un-Russian
- chief minister, Plehve, and others hoped that a short successful war with Japan would create more attachment to the government
	- its failure created the reverse

January 1905, "Bloody Sunday" in St. Petersburg: peasants drew up a petition and gathered before the tsar's Winter Palace 
- destroyed the government's moral ground, sparked a wave of political strikes
- all agreed on one demand—that there should be more democratic representation in the government
- tsar yielded grudgingly 
	- March 1905: tsar promised to call to office men "enjoying the confidence of the nation"
	- August: agreed to call a kind of Estates General
	- tsar issued his October Manifesto, promising a constitution, civil liberties, and a Duma to be elected by all classes alike with powers to enact laws and control the administration after the ST. Petersberg Soviet (workers') council led by Mensheviks declared ba great general strike, stopping railroads, closing banks, shutting down newspapers, etc, which soon spread to other cities and then peasants
		- tsar intended to divide opposition by releasing the October Manifesto
		- authorities arrested members of the St. Petersburg Soviet, peace was made with Japan, and revolutionary leaders fled back to Europe or went underground

## The Results of 1905: The Duma

appeared as if Russia would have a sort of parliamentary state
- but Nicholas II announced in 1906 that the Duma would have no power over foreign policy, the budget, or government personnel
	- refused to allow any real participation in the government by the public
- first Duma elected in 1906 by a system of indirect and unequal voting, where peasants and workers voted as separate classes with far less representation than landlords
	- two months later, the tsar dismissed the Duma
- a second Duma elected in 1907 with the government trying to contorl the elections through suppression of party meetings and newspapoers
	- 83 socialists were elected
	- Cadets, fearful of revolutionary left, concluded that constitutional progress must be gradual
	- ended when government denounced and arrested ~50 socialists as revolutionaries bent on destruction
- third Duma elected after an electoral change that gave increased representation to the landed propertied class and guaranteed a conservative majority (1907-1912)
- fourth Duma (1912-1916)

## The Stolypin Reforms

Peter Stolypin, principal minister from 1906 to 1911
- thought that the way to checkmate revolutionaries was for the government to attract the support of reasonable and moderate people by a program of reforms
- had dissolved hte first two Dumas
- wanted to build up the propertied class as friends of the state
- hoped to replace the *mir* with a regime of private individual property
	- abolisehd what was left of redemption payments for which the *mirs* had been collectively responsible
	- allowed each peasant to sell his share of the communal rights and to leave the commune at will
	- authorized them to buy land freely from the communes, form each other,m or from the country
	- favored the rise of "big farmers" (kulaks)
	- hastened formation of a migratory wage-earning class
- was shot dead while attending the theater in Kiev in the presence of the tsar and tsarina in 1911
	- assassin = members of the terrorist wing of the Social Revolutionaries, thought to be a secret agent of the reactionary tsarist police


# 85. The International Anarchy

## Rival Alliances: Triple Alliance versus Triple Entente

once united, Germany entered their industrial revolution
- manufacturing, finance, shipping, and population grew exponentially
- Germans felt like they deserved a "place in the sun" aka acknowledged supremacy like the British, which EF were against
	- F: wanted Alsace and Lorraine back (annexed to Germany in 1871)
	- E: unhappy with German competitors in their foreign markets as and as colonial rivals, and as other European states gravitated into the Berline orbit

Triple Alliance: AIG in 1879 (Italy joined in 1882)
- Bismarck after 1871 feared that his  German Empire would be torn apart in another European war, so he followed a policy of peace until his retirement in 1890
- terms of the alliance: if any members became involved in war with two or more powers, its allies should come to iots aid by force of arms
- Bismarck alos signed a "reinsurance" treaty with Russia because Russia
	- delicate point: Russia and Austria were enemies because of the Balkans
- after Bismarck's retirement, his system proved too intricate for his successors to managed, so the Russo-German agreement lapsed, the Franco-Russian Alliance be4ing signed in 1894
	- considered impossible because the French Republic stood for everything radical while the Russian empire stood for everything reactionary and autocratic

now much depended on what Britain would do
- Fashoda and Boer War came as a shock because they had long prided themselves on their "splendid isolation"
- British relations with FR were bad, so some thought that it was better to seek better relations with Germany
	- obstacles: 
		- Kruger Telegram of 1896
		- 1898: Germany built a navy, sparking a naval competition between Germany and GB; by 1912, it was felt a menace to Britain because sea power was the foundation of Britain's greatness
			- Germany insisted that they needed a navy to protect their colonies, secure their foreign trade, and "for the general purposes of their greatness"
			- British held that they must at all coosts control the sea in both peace and war, stubbornly maintaining a navy as large as the nexrt two combined
			- naval race led to enormous expenditures and drove British into the arms of FR

Britain emerged from their diplomatic isolation
- 1902: military alliance with Japan against Russia
- 1904: British and French governments agreed to forget Fashoda
	- French recognized British occupation of Egypt
	- British recognized French penetration of Morocco
	- cleared up other colonial differences
	- *entente cordiale* - a close understanding
	- French went to reconcile E with R
- 1907: Anglo-Russian Convention, ER settled their differences
	- recognized respective spheres of influence in Persia
- Triple Entente: EFR (but British refused to make formal military commitments)

## The Crises in Morocco and the Balkans

March 1905: William II made a speech in favor of Moroccan independence at Tangier
- Germany wanted to break up the new understanding between France and England
- Germans demanded and obtained an international conference at Algeciras in 1906, but only Austria voted with Germany
- in response, EF became closer and their officers began discussing common plans

1911: the *Panther*, a German gunboat, arrived at Agadir to "protect German interests", demanding the French Congo
- member of British cabinet, David Lloyd George, made an inflammatory speech on the German menace

crises of the Balkans:
- Slavic Revival -> they became the South Slavs, or the Yugoslavs
- after the Dual Monarchy, the Slavs of the Habsburg empire were kept subordinate to the German Austrians and the Hungarian Magyars; radical Slav nationalists  concluded by 1900 that they would never gain equal status under the Dual Monarchy, so the South Slavs needed to form a state of their own
- Serbia became the center of South Slav agitation

1908: Russian and Austrian foreign ministers met at a conference at Bachlau, agreeing to call an international conference in which Russia would favor Austrian annexation of Bosnia and Austria would support the oopening of the Straits to Russian warships
- sparked by two events:
	- Young Turks carried through a revolution, obliging the sultan to restore the liberal parliamentary constitution of 1876
	- Russia turned actively to the Balkan and Turkish scene after its defeat in the RJ war
- without waiting for a conference, Austria proclaimed their annexation of Bosnia, infuriating the Serbs 
- Bulgaria became independent and Crete united with Greece
- EF refused to back Russia regarding Constantinople, and E was wary of letting Russia into the Straits
- a conference was never called

1911: Italy declared war on Turkey, conquering Tripoli and the Dodecanese Islands
- Bulgaria, Serbia, and Greece then joined forces against Turkey, soon defeating it
- formation of the kingdom of Albania
	- Serbs occupied part of it in the two Balkan wars, the Greeks claimed a part, and it had occasionally been promised to Italy
	- Russia supported the Serbian claim, but Austria wanted to shut Serbia off from the sea

impact: left feelings of exasperation in Austria, desperation in Serbia, and humiliation in Russia

## The Sarajevo Crisis and the Outbreaks of War

June 28, 1914: Bosnian revolutionary (members of the Serbian secret society called "Union or Death" aka Black Hand) assassinated the heir to the Habsburg empire, the Archduke Francis Ferdinand in Sarajevo, the Bosnian capital, in the Austrian Empire
- he was known to want to reform and grant Slav greater equality, a threat to revolutionaries
- Austria decided to crush Serbian independence, but not to annex it because it was thought that there were too many Slavs within the empire already
- Germans' famous "blank check" - encouraged Austria to be firm vs. Serbia
- Serbs counted on Russia (because if it yielded a third time it would lose all Balkan influence); Russia counted on France, who, wanting Russia as an ally in the case of a war with Germany, gave Russia a blank check
- Serbs rejected Austrian ultimatum and so Austria declared war
- Russia rsashly mobilized its army on the Germans, expecting them to join Austria
- August 1, 1914: Germany demanded an end to Russian mobilization on its border and receiving no answer, declared war on Russia
- August 3: convinced that France would enter war on Russia's side, Germany also declared war on France
- German decisions posted on a hope that E wouldn't enter the war, which was uncertain because only Parliament could declare war, so the foreign office could make no binding promise of war in advance
	- but it was almost certain that E would fight because of its deep commitment to France, so this was an act of folly
- August 4: after Germany violated Belgian neutrality to attack France more swiftly, England declared war on Germany+

it escalated to this point because of the alliance system, so every incident was a test of strength between the two alliances
- every nation lived in fear of some future vague war in which its allies would be necessary
- Germans complained of being encircled by FR, so they needed AH as its ally
- French dreaded conflict with Germany, so they needed to cling to Russia
- Russia and Austria were both tottering empires
- German internal crisis: Social Democrats became the largest party in the Reichstag in 1912, but the German imperial government paid no regard to them and army and navy interests were strong there

root of trouble:
- world had an international economy but a national polity
- every nation was dependent on other nations and insecure, especially industrial countries
- no world state to police the worldwide system
- so this was driven by each Great Power trying to stake out part of the world system for itself
