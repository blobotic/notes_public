# 94. The Union of Soviet Socialist Republics

## Government: The Nationalities and Federalism

1922: Union of Soviet Socialist Republics established
- Russia Soviet Federated Socialist Republic, Ukrainian Soviet Socialist Republic, Byelorussian (White Russian) Soviet Socialist Republic, and the Transcaucasian Soviet Federated Socialist Republic (Georgia, Armenia, and Azerbaijan)
- 1924: constitution formally adopted, declared to "unite the workers of all countries into one World Soviet Socialist Republic" -> fluid and expansible
- federal principle designed to answer nationalism
	- tsardom's solution: systematic Russification, encountering nationalist resistance that fatally weakened the empire
- in practice, the Russian SFSR was > 50% of the population and > 75% of the territory of the Union, so the Union became marked by Russian and Slavic character

## Government: State and Party

parallelism, in theory:
- on one hand was the state
	- council/soviet: elections took place, authority proceeded from the bottom upward to the top
	- constitution of 1924: only workers could vote; bourgeois and priests were excluded from suffrage
	- constitution of 1936: more direct, voters directly elected members of higher soviets + secret ballot, no class denied the vote; bicameral parliament (Supreme Soviet) created with an upper chamber (Soviet of Nationalities) and a lower chamber (Soviet of the Union, one representative per 300k people)
	- seemingly democratic
- on the other, paralleling but not a part of the state, was the party
	- only the Communist party; authority began at top and proceeded downward
	- Central Committee of ~100 people, in which a Politburo of a dozen members dominated
	- succeeded the Leninist ideal of a highly disciplined party filled of faithful and zealous workers who willingly carried out orders
	- function of party was to carry out the dictatorship of the proletariat; it decided what the state should do
	- those in the party enjoyed a higher social class and developed bourgeois interests
	- repressed originality, boldness, risk-taking, and freedom of thought/action - stagnation
- close interlocking relationship made it meaningless

## The New Economic Policy, 1921-1927

famine:
- "war communism" had antagonized the peasants + severe drought + breakdown of transportation
- millions died; country left in ruins after WWI, the Revolution, the civil wars, the Terror, etc

Lenin's New Economic Policy (NEP), 1921-1927 - a compromise with capitalism
- while the state owned the basic productive industries, it allowed private trading for private profit to restore trade between town and country so that peasants would produce beyond the needs of their own substinence
- favored big individualist farmer, so peasant families consolidated private property while others became proletarians aka wage-earners
- favored new-rich commercial class, neobourgeois
- repaired damage of war and revolution, but no progress

## Stalin and Trotsky

1924: Lenin died at age 54 after a series of strokes
- in death, party presented him as a deified equal of Marx himself and argued over his intentions

Leon Trotsky
- doctrine of "permanent revolution," an incessant drive for proletarian world revolution
- on the other hand, many in the party wanted to first build socialism in one country
- denounced tendency of bureaucratic ossification and urged a new movement of the masses
- called for more forceful develpment of industry and for the collectivization of agriculture
- demanded immediate adoption of an overall plan/central control
- under Stalin's masterminding, Trotsky was exiled and later murdered

## 95. Stalin: The Five-Year Plans and the Purges

## Economic Planning

1928: First Five-Year Plan: aimed at rapid industrialization and the collectivization of agriculture
- central "planning" of country's whole economic life, distinctive feature of Soviet economics
- took so long because Marxism was a theory about class war instead of a concrete plan; Engels: capitalism only existed between private enterprises, so treat all economic life as one factory united under one enormous monopoly/management
- "planned" society made its first actual appearance in WWI, adopting centralized controls under the passion for victory
- plan for 5 years in the future to:
	- strengthen and enrich the country
	- make it militarily and industrially self-sufficient
	- lay groundwork for a true workers' society
	- overcome Russian reputation for backwardness
- declared fulfilled in 1932
- administered by the Gosplan, which determined how much of every article the country should produce, workers' wages, etc
	- plans needed to be constantly amended and revised
- primary objective was to build up the heavy industry / capital wealth of the USSR, to industrialize without foreign loans, stepping away from its agricultural roots

1932-1937: Second Five-Year Plan

1938-1941: Third Five-Year Plan, interrupted by the war with Germany

## The Collectivization of Agriculture

originally, only 1/5th of the farm population would be collectivized, but Stalin revised it in the winter of 1929 to include the majority of the peasantry
- individual peasants were to pool their privately owned fields and livestock into collectives to be collectively owned by the peasants that resided on it
- wealthiest peasants resisted, so they were deported/killed, destroying the property-owning, labor-hiring, "bourgeois" peasants and returning the peasants to Marx's vision of the proletariat 
- village class war that killed the majority of the farmers and livestock, leading to a deadly famine in southeast Russia in 1932 that killed millions
- collectivization made it possible to apply capital to the soil with machines
- by 1939: all but a negligible fraction of the peasantry was collectivized
- ultimately failed to increase agricultural output, but it augmented the supply of industrial workers, allowing for greater industrialization

## The Growth of Industry

at first, there was a dependence on capitalist countries

Second Five-Year Plan, launched in 1933
- greater determination than the first to cut down imports and achieve national self-sufficiency, especially in the heavy industry basic to war production
- most rapid (exponential) industrial growth in a decade in any country
- also called for a development of industry east of the Urals, bringing a modernization of life for the first time to inner Asia
	- USSR traded less with foreign countries and more with Asia than the former Russia
	- allowed the "socialist fatherland" to absorb terrible losses and strike back against the Germans, later
- modernization ultimately impressive because of how little Russia started from

## Social Costs and Social Effects of the Plans

demanded a huge and continuing sacrifice from the people, in  hopes of achieving the vision of the Promised Land

did away with some evils of unrestrained free enterprise
- no acknowledged unemployment, no cycle of boom and depression, less misuse of women and children, minimum below which no one was supposed to fall

no economic equality - high government officials, highly skilled people, etc received the highest awards

competition increased because Soviet workers were paid per piece instead of per hour
- government pronounced the movement "a new and higher stage of socialist competition"
- failures to meet the plan led to denouncements of managers/industries, who might lose their job, social status, or life - betrayal of Soviet society

people believed that the new industrial wonders were their own

solidarity purchased at the price of totalitarianism

## The Purge Trials of the 1930s

1936: new constitution proclaimed
- enumerated rights of Soviet citizens the usual rights of the West but also steady employment, rest, leisure, economic security, and a comfortable old age
- all racism condemned, reorganized the Soviet republics and granted equal and direct universal suffrage
- Communist party remained sole governing group and Stalin tightened dictatorship; party racked by internal troubles
- West looked favorably on it

1933: party underwent a drastic purge, expelling 1/3 of its members (open disagreement was banned)
- Stalin assassinated hundreds of opponents

series of sensational trials took place
- 1936: 16 Old Bolsheviks who had been exiled were brought to trial; to the world's surprise, all the accused made full confession to their charges in open court and were executed
- 1937: 17 other Old Bolsheviks also died or received long prison sentences
- 1938: Bukharin and others ("rightists") were charged with wanting to restore bourgeois capitalism and executed
- other arrests, private inquisitions, and executions
- between 1930-1953, 3,778,334 people had been tried and sentenced for "couerrevolutionary activity", 786,098 executed, others died in prison camps
- Great Terror of 1934-1938
- enforced Stalin's dictatorship, eradicating all opposing voices

# 96. The International Impact of Communism, 1919-1939

## Socialism and the First World War

Zimmerwald program:
- Lenin and other socialists thought that the only true war was civil war
- called for immediate peace without annexations or indemnities, soon split
- "Zimmerwald Left": hoped that war would go on until it caused social revolution

## The Founding of the Third International

Lenin founded a new International of his own to discredit moderate socialism and to claim for the Communists the true line of succession from Marx's first International
- Third/Communist International = Comintern
- 1919: first congress of the Third International was haphazard
- 1920: second congress, 37 countries represented, although Russian party dominated
	- Lenin's Twenty-One Points
- they hated socialists the most because they were both competing for the leadership of the world's working class
- called themselves Communist and obliged to accept strong international centralization under the Executive Committee
- the USSR used the Comintern/other diplomatic channels to promote world revolution
- 1927: with the suppression of Trotskyism and world revolutionism in Russia, and with the concentration under Stalin on a program of building socialism in one country, the Comintern moderated its activities
- 1935: USSR instructed all Communist parties to ally with socialists/advanced liberals to combat fascism and reaction
- 1943: USSR abolished Comintern as a gesture of goodwill to GB and the US

USSR exerted its influence by the fact of its existence, not through the Comintern
- noncommunists who disliked capitalism thought they could attain Soviet results without the use of Soviet methods
- idea of "planning" began to find favor

## 97. The Advance of Democracy after 1919

economy in both victors and losers alike suffered
- farms and factories faced a sudden disappearance of markets, producing more than could be sold so that the war was followed by a sharp postwar depression

## Gains of Democracy and Social Democracy

new states all adopted written constitutions and universal suffrage
- GB - universal male suffrage in 1918
- growing enfranchisement of women
	- 9128: vote granted to women on equal basis with men
	- 1920: female suffrage became general in the US
	- also in Germany and in most of the new states of Europe
	- Soviet Union: women received the vote after the Revolution in 1917

old prewar socialists gained strength - party of peaceable/revisionist Marxism

labor unions grew

Italy was the only state in which democracy received a sharp setback
- 1922: Benito Mussolini founded his Fascist regime after killing off the Italian parliament, becoming the first of the dictators of postwar Europe outside the Soviet Union

## The New States of Central and East-Central Europe

new states:
- Austria, Hungary, Czechoslovakia, and Yugoslavia, from the Habsburg empire
- Poland, Finland, Estonia, Latvia, and Lithuania, from the russian empire
- embodied the principle of national self-determination (one nation, one government; political sovereignty)
- attempted to make themselves democratic / republics

## Economic Problems of Eastern Europe; Land Reform

Eastern Europe for centuries had been agrarian w/ large landed estates, the middle class of business and professional men small except in Austria, Bohemia, and the western portion of Czechoslovakia
- new states tried to modernize themselves
	- democratic and constitutional ideas
	- protective tariffs
	- develop factories and industries of their own
- national boundaries created difficulties, goods circulated less easily, protected industries produced inefficiently and expensively

reform of landownership, overturned the traditional agrarian base of society
- Baltic states: big properties belonged to the "Baltic barons", German descendants of the Teutonic Knights
- Estonia, Latvia, and Lithuania: nationalist dislike for Germans made it easier to liquidate landlords
- Czechoslovakia: >50% of arable lands transferred from large to small owners
- Romania/Yugoslavia: breakup of large estates less thorough
- Finland, Bulgaria, and Greece: small landownership already common
- Poland and Hungary: least success, landed magnates were exceptionally strong and well-rooted

land reforms didn't solve basic economic problems
- peasant owners of new small farms lacked capital, agricultural skill, and knowledge of the market
- farm productivity didn't rise

## 98. The German Republic and the Spirit of Locarno

after November 1918: Social Democrats ruled (a tamer version of Marxism)
- now conservative, more anxious to preserve what they had already achieved, although they were left before 1917 (middle group)
- January 1919: the Spartacists attempted to bring about a proletarian revolution in Germany, like that in Russia, aided by Lenin and the Russian Bolsheviks
	- Social Democratic Provisional Government crushed the Spartacist uprising

July 1919, city of Weimar: a constitution adopted establishing a democratic republic (the Weimar Republic, 1919-1933)
- highly democratic: universal suffrage (including women), proportional representation, and the initiative, referendum, and recall
- except for the legal eight-hour day and other safeguards to workers' welfare and traditional demands of organized labor, it wasn't particularly socialistic
	- no industries nationalized
	- no property redistributed
	- no land laws/agrarian reforms

## The German Democracy and Versailles

Weimar Republic and the Treaty of Versailles were both products of the defeat of Germany in the war
- if democracy in Germany meant perpetual acceptance of the treaty or economic distress/hardship as a consequence of the treaty, then democracy would lose its appeal
- expected to recover at least the Polish corridor and merge with German-speaking Austria; viewed the Treaty of Versailles as a dictated peace, Carthaginian, ruthless, and vengeful

France terrified of Germany's recovery, unable to detach the Rhineland from Germany
- League of Nations offered little assurance of safety to France
- formed alliances with Poland, Czechoslovakia, and other east-European states
- insisted on German payment of reparations
- Weimar government looked to the Soviet Union (no hand in the Treaty of Versailles and claimed no reparations); Soviet government prepared to enter normal diplomatic relations with established governments

1922: Treaty of Rapallo between Germany and the Soviet Union

## Reparations, the Great Inflation of 1923, Recovery

1923: France sent army to occupy industrial sights of the Ruhr valley; Germany responded with general strikes and passive resistance
- inflation because the Weimar government mass-printed paper to sustain the workers
- inflation brought around massive social revolution as paper money became absolutely worthless
	- middle class pauperized and demoralized
	- materially, they were like the proletariat, but their view of life made it impossible for them to identify as the working class or accept Marxism/socialism
	- a moral void was created, with their hope in society lost

1924: Dawes Plan, made by the US, who demanded payment of huge war debts owed to it by the Allies, who insisted that they could not repay them without collecting reparations from Germany
- French evacuated Ruhr
- reparations payments cutdown
- arrangements made for German republic to borrow abroad
- American private capital invested in Germany
- for 4-5 years, the Weimar Republic enjoyed a bustling prosperity, albeit one that rested on foreign loans

## The Spirit of Locarno

1925 at Locarno: European powers signed a number of treaties
- Germany signed a treaty with France and Belgium guaranteeing their respective frontiers unconditionally
- Germany signed arbitration treaties with Poland and Czechoslovakia, guaranteeing that they would attempt changes in them only by international discussion, agreement, or arbitration
- France signed treaties with Poland and Czechoslovakia promising military aid if attacked by Germany
- GB promised military aid for the frontiers of Belgium and France against Germany in the event of violation, but not to Czechoslovakia or Poland

1926: Germany joins League of Nations

1928: Pact of Paris - affirmed will of nations to renounce war as an instrument of national policy

# 100. The Great Depression: Collapse of the World Economy

## The Prosperity of the 1920s and Its Weakness

1924-1929: period of prosperity, with international trade, building, and development of new industries
- flaws: 
	- expansion largely financed by credit/borrowing
	- wages lagged behind profits and dividends so mass purchasing power weak
	- 1920s: decade of chronic agricultural depression
		- consequence of WWI reducing fields (ex. wheat)

1929: acute phase of the Great Depression - no reserve of purchasing power on the farms

## The Crash of 1929 and the Spread of Economic Crisis

stock market and financial crisis - stocks pushed higher by years of continuing expansion and high dividends
- October 1929: NY Stock Exchange, values driven up by excessive speculation from both professional + ordinary people
- 1931: failure of the Creditanstalt, a leading Vienna bank - bankruptices + business calamities
- unemployment ran rampant

## Reactions to the Crisis

greatest economic consequence of depression: movement toward economic nationalism 
- internationalism of money, gold standard, and free convertibility of currencies gradually abandoned
- 1931: GB off the gold standard, devaluating the pound -> then 20+ other countries

trade became increasingly bilateral (i.e. countries had to obtain products from countries with which they had sold enough products to themselves)

currency control way of holding export markets in times of depression
- or shut out competitive imports via protective tariffs
- quotas/quantitative restrictions
- economy disintegrated into competing national economic systems

1933: International Monetary and Economic Conference in London
- attempted to unclog world trade but failed
- soon after: Allies defaulted on debt payments to the US, legislation denied them the right to float bonds in the american securities market -> more economic nationalism

# 102. Trials and Adjustments of Democracy in Britain and France

## British Politics: The 1920s and the Depression

GB: in depression and suffered severely from unemployment
- "dole" - benefit payments, welfare state
	- Ramsay MacDonald (PM in 1924 + 1929), who planned to introduce a severe retrenchment policy (reduce dole payments)

## Britain and the Commonwealth: Imperial Relations

don't care

## France: The 1920s and the Coming of the Depression

Raymond Poincaré of the moderate conservative right
- 1923: sent troops into the Ruhr 
- saved the franc
- reparations important to France because it had began a large-scale reconstruction program to repair wartime devastation that depended on the reparations to pay
- debt mounted, balanced budget impossible, franc declined
- 1926: national union ministry under Poincaré inaugurated new taxes, tightened tax collection, and cut down on government expenditure, stabilizing the franc
- less severe than in the US or Germany

## Depression Ferment and the Popular front

fascist-type leagues in imitation of Italy/Germany + right-wing veterans' associations

riots of February 1934: fascist mob assembled in the Place de la Concorde, threatened the Chamber, and battled with the police
- several killed, hundreds injured
- French liberals/democrats, organized labor, and socialists outraged
- liberals, socialists, and communists coalitioned into the Popular Front (like those in many other countries in the 1930s)
	- pledge to defend the republic against fascism, to take measures against the depression, and to introduce labor reforms
- spring 1936: won in the polls, French Socialists became leading party in the Chamber for the first time

## The Popular Front and After

reforms:
- 40 hour week, vacations with pay, collective bargaining law
	- nationwide signing of collective contracts and growth in trade union membership
	- labor strength also increased when Communist + non-Communist labor confederations reunited
- nationalize armaments and aviation industry
- Bank of France reorganized
- machinery established for arbitration of labor disputes
- price fixing and government purchases of wheat for farmers
- "French New Deal" - Blum

disssatisfaction:
- French employers balked at cooperating and tried to pass rising production costs to consumer
- labor disgruntled at price rises that coueracted wage gains
- 40 hour week -> plants shut down for 2 days a week instead of operating in shifts
- industrial production barely rose
- gold kept bleeding out of the country
- Popular Front disintegrated after the communists attacked the government for refusing aid to the Spanish Popular Front during the Spanish Civil WAr in July 1936

## Western Europe and the Depression

Europe's economic dependence on the US, USSR becoming industrial giant, western Europe incapable of properly utilizing existing machinery

## 103. Italian Fascism

first exception to the apparent victory of democracy was Italy after Mussolini declared Fascist Italy in 1922
- before the war, Mussolini was revolutionary and a left-wing socialist
- during the war he turned intensely nationalist

Italy had entered the war for promises of territorial and colonial spoils, which were not granted despite Italy suffering 600k+ deaths and from the burden of wartime debt and acute postwar depression and unemployment
- social unrest spread
	- tenant farmers refused to pay rents, peasants burnt crops and destroyed livestock
	- strikes in cities in heavy industry and transportation
- subsided by late summer 1920, although violence in streets persisted

1919: first postwar election held
- law adding proportional representation to the universal male suffrage that was introduced in 1913
- Socialists + Catholic Popular/Christian Socialist popular

1921: new elections held after postwar disturbances
- liberals and democrats, moderate socialists, and the Catholic Popular party popular
- Mussolini's Fascist movement won 35/~500 seats

Mussolini at first went along with the radical tide before presenting himself as the upholder of national law, order, and property, against social agitation
- attracted propertied classes after the seeming threat of social revolution
- rallied patriots and nationalists
- attracted lower middle class, pinched by economic inflation and unprotected by labor unions or socialist movements

October 1922: "March on Rome"
- Blackshirts mobilized on Rome, Mussolini remained in Milan
- when king refused to approve martial law, the cabinet resigned and Mussolini named premier

Mussolini's 2/3 law - the plurality in the election automatically receives 2/3 of the seats in the legislature

Fascist corporative system: provided for the division of all economic life into 22 major areas, for each of which a corporation was established

Mussolini: program of public works and increasing economic self-sufficiency
- "battle of wheat"

fascism regarded as a possible alternative to democratic or parliamentary government, a corrective to troubles whose reality no one could deny


everyone else hated it, but in nationalistic, east-European countries with disgruntled landowners, Fascism held considerable appeal

# 104. Totalitarianism: Germany's Third Reich

## The Rise of Adolf Hitler

Hitler joined at the army's behest the German Workers' party and soon became its leader (to combat socialist and democratic propaganda and to keep alive a patriotic and military spirit)
- 1920: proclaimed its 25-point program, calling the party now the National Socialist German Workers' party, aka the Nazis

end of 1923: Hitler denounced the Weimar government for shameful submission to the French after France occupied Ruhr and, in imitation of Mussolini's march on Rome, they staged the "beer hall *Putsch*" in Munich
- Hitler: "national revolution has broken out"
- police suppressed disturbance and Hitler sentenced to 5 years in prison but released in < 1 year
- in prison, he wrote *Mein Kampf (My Struggle)*

after France left Ruhr, Germany enjoyed an economic revival

no country suffered more than Germany from the worldwide economic collapse
- foreign loans abruptly ceased or were recalled
- factories ground to a halt
- 6 million unemployed
- middle class hadn't recovered when it was struck again, so they lost all faith in the economic system and its future
- stirred up universal German loathing for the Treaty of Versailles
- Hitler inflamed such feelings

election of 1930: Nazi won 107 seats from 12 in 1928

July 1932: Nazis more than doubled their popular vote, won 230 seats, and were by far the largest single party although they fell short of a majority

January 30, 1933: Hitler became chancellor of the German Republic
- Hitler called for another election, determined to replace the Nationalists on the cabinet by Nazis
- a week before election the Reichstag building caught fire, and they blamed it on the Communists with a Red scare
- Nazis only won 44% of the vote, and 52% with their Nationalist allies
- Hitler was voted dictatorial powers

## The Nazi State

Hitler called his new order the Third Reich, carrying on the process of true German history
- claimed to represent the absolute sovereignty of the German people

June 30, 1934: Nazi party violently purged when many of the old Brownshirt leaders, those who represented the more social revolutionary wing of the movement, were accused of plotting against Hitler and shot
- Gestapo + People's Courts + system of permanent concentration camps suppressed all opposing ideas
- law and churches defined and coordinated within the new regime
- labor uions coordinated, replaced by a National Labor Front; stries forbidden
- extensive public works program launched, reforestation and swamp drainage projects organized, housing and superhighways built
- government assumed increasing controls over industry while leaving ownership in private hands

1936: Four-Year Plan of economic development
- set up the goal of autarchy and self-sufficiency, absolute independence from foreign trade

## Totalitarianism: Some Origins and Consequences

differences between Soviet and Germany:
- theoretically, the proletarian dictatorship was temporary and it did not glorify the individual hero, nor was it nationalistic
	- adopted democratic-sounding constitution
	- individual rights
- as time passed, Soviet totalitarianism became harder to distinguish from others

totalitarianism was a development of the heavy-handed state sovereignty 
- drew heavily on an exaggerated historic nationalism
- individuals had no independent existence; they received all from the society/people/nation they were born into and by which they were nurtured
- group as a whole as a solid block

totalitarian regimes attempted to shape people's ideas actively
- propaganda became principal branch of government
- racism was a further exaggeration of older ideas of nationalism and national solidarity
- escape from realities of class conflict, a way of pretending that the differences between rich and poor were of minor importance
	- appeared by stirring up class fears and then acting like it had solved the class problem
- blamed their troubles on forces outside the country
- violence and the glorification of violence was characteristic of totalitarian governments; a cult of violence
	- body cult flourished while the mind decays

## The Spread of Dictatorship

by 1938, only 10/27 European countries remained democratic
- GB, France, Holland, Belgium, Switzerland, Czechoslovakia, Finland, and the three Scandinavian countries (Finland, Sweden, Norway)
- new dictatorship/authoritarian systems rested on a combination of personal and military power but absorbed some ideological features of fascism
	- repressed individual liberties, banned opposition parties, and abolished/nullified parliamentary institutions
	- established corporative state, outlawed independent labor organizations, and forbade strikes
	- some instituted anti-Semitic legislation

acceptance and glorification of violence: feature most clearly distinguishing totalitarian from democratic systems

# 105. The Weakness of the Democracies: Again to War

Western pacifism, insistence on peace regardless of consequences
- many people now believed that WWI had been a mistake and that little or nothing had been gained by it; unconvinced about the totality of German blame
- France: half of all French males aged 20-32 in 1914 had been killed; refused to repeat such a holocaust
	- if war came, they expected it to be fought on the Maginot Line, which they built on their eastern frontier facing Germany
	- similar situation prevailed in GB and the US

USSR revisionist and didn't accept the new frontiers of eastern Europe nor Russia's territorial losses in WWI
- obsessed by fear of attack and invasion
- alarmed by Germany because Hitler had declared that he meant to obliterate Bolshevism and subordinate large stretches of eastern Europe ot Germany
- interested in collective security, international action against aggression
	- 1934: joined League of Nations
	- instructed Communist parties to work w/ socialists and liberals in popular fronts
	- checked fascist aggressors

## The March of Nazi and Fascist Aggression

Hitler gradually pushed on the Allies' bounds, ensuring that they would let him have his way
- 1933: took Germany out of the League and the Disarmament Conference then taking place
- 1934: signed a nonaggression treaty with Poland, France's longterm ally
- 1934: Nazis of Austria assassinated the Austrian chancellor and demanded the union of Austria with Germany
	- no reaction from the western powers; Mussolini suppressed it
- January 1935: plebiscite conducted in the Saar, which voted for reuion with the Reich
- March 1935: Hitler repudiated the clauses in the Versailles treaty intended to keep Germany disarmed, openly building up German armed forces
	- EFI protested but did nothing
	- E entered into a naval agreement with Germany
- March 7, 1936: repudiated the Locarno agreements and reoccupied the Rhineland, justifying it with the new Franco-Soviet pact
- 1938: German forces moved into Austria and the *Anschluss* - union of Germany and Austria - was complete
- September 1938: Czechoslovakia and the Munich crisis

Mussolini: in 1935, Italy went to war with Ethiopia, proving the League of Nations incapable of stopping a Great Power

## The Spanish Civil War, 1936-1939

1933: government fell into hands of rightist and conservative parties, who ruled through ineffective and unpopular ministries

February 1936: new elections held
- republicans, socialists, syndicalists, anarchists, communists joined in a Popular Front
- vs monarchists, clericals, army officers, other adherents of the old regime, Falangists (Spanish fascists)
- left won a victory and pressed forward with a reform program

July 1936: General Francisco Franco led a group of military men in an insurrection against the republican government
- country fell into civil war; over 600k dead

Britan and France resolved to not let the war expand into general conflict
- forbade shipment of war materials to republican government
- French Popular Front government didn't send aid to the hard-pressed Spanish Popular Front

Germany, Italy, and the Soviet Union intervened anyway
- IG supported Franco and denounced the republicans aas the tools of Bolshevism
	- helped bring Germany and Italy together
- USSR supported the republic

1936: Rome-Berlin Axis between Mussolini and Hitler
- Japan had also signed with Germany an Anti-Comintern Pact, soon ratified by Italy, an agreement to oppose communism, the foundation for a diplomatic alliance

1938: Mussolini accepted the German absorption of Austria

## The Munich Crisis: Climax of Appeasement

Czechoslovakia strategic keystone of Europe
- alliance with France and the Soviet Union (contingent on French alliance)
- formed Little Entente with Romania and Yugoslavia
- well-trained army, important munitions industries, and strong fortifications against Germany that were in a largely German area of Czechoslovakia 

Sudeten: Czechoslovakia, under pressure from Britain and France, offered them regional autonomy, but Hitler continued stirring them up
- Soviets urged a firms stand but the Westrn powers feared that firmenss might mean war

September 1938: Neville Chamberlain flew to Germany twice; Hitler raised his demands so high that France and England could no longer accept his terms, and mobilization began


Hitler invited Chamberlain and Daladier, the French premier, to a four-power conference at Munich with Mussolini; Soviet Union and Czechoslovak excluded
- Chamberlain and Daladier accepted Hitler's terms
	- pressure on Czech to sign its own death warrant
	- France repudiated its treaty obligation to protect Czechoslovakia and abandoned Little Entente
	- Soviets reaffiremd their willingness to aid the Czechs if the French enacted

## End of Appeasement

March 1939: Hitler marched into Bohemia-Moravia, the Czech part of Czechoslovakia, turning it into a German protectorate and declared Slovakia independent
- then seized Memel from Lithuania and raised demands for Danzig and the Polish Corridor
- France and Britain realized that Hitler was insatiable
- April 1993: Mussolini took over albania
- western powers began preparing for a military stand

Poland and Baltic states unwilling to allow soviet armies within their borders

Soviets thought that EF really wanted them to take the brunt of the Nazi attack, considering it an affront that E had sent lesser officials as negotiators to Moscow when the PM had flown 3 times to deal with Hitler

August 23, 1939: Soviets signed a treaty of nonaggression and friendship with Germany (Nazi-Soviet Pact), stunning the world
- signal for war; all negotiations failed

September 1: Germans invaded Poland

September 3: GB and F declare war on Germany, start of WWII

# 106. The Years of Axis Triumph

## Nazi Europe, 1939-1940: Poland and the Fall of France

WWII opened with a German assault on Poland (Blitzkrieg)
- outcome clear within a few days, organized resistance ended within a month
- simultanouesly, Soviet Union moved into the eastern half of Poland 2 weeks after German invasion
- Soviets also established fortified bases in the Baltic states (Estonia, Latvia, Lithuania), but Finland resisted
- November 1939: Soviets attacked Finland when negotiations foundered, and the Soviet Union was expelled from the League of Nations
- March 1940: fighting over; Finland had to yield more territory than originally demanded but retained its independence

deceptively quiet in the west

April 9, 1940: Germany attacked and overran Norway, then Denmark
