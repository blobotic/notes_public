# Unit 5: Scientific Revolution and Enlightenment

## 32. Prophets of a Scientific Civilization: Bacon and Descartes

### Science before the Seventeenth Century

Leonardo da Vinci (1452-1519) - artist, engineer, and scientific thinker
- dissection of dead bodies -> human anatomy
- circulation of the blood
- movement of the earth about the sun

Science provided Europe with a new faith in itself

### Bacon and Descartes

Francis Bacon, English (1561-1626) and Rene Descartes, French (1596-1650)
- pursued knowledge
- disdained beliefs of preceding generations
- ridiculed the tendency to put faith in ancient books
- attacked the scholastics
	- their method was rationalistic and deductive, which they thought to be backward: instead of postulating truths, we find truths at the end
- scientific method

Bacon:
- *Instauratio Magna* / "Great Renewal"
	- *Novum Organum*, 1620 - new method of acquiring knowledge, the inductive method, particular to general
	- *The Advancement of Learning*, 1623 - true knowledge was useful knowledge
- *The NEw Atlantis* (1627) - scientific utopia
- the fact that knowledge could be used for practical purposes proved that it was true knowledge, and knowledge was power
- greatest weakness was he was busy as the Lord Chancellor of England and he failed to understand mathematics

Descartes:
- great mathematician
- invented coordinate geometry
- *Discourse on Method*, 1637
- systematic doubt
- "I think, therefore I exist" 
- deduced the existence of God and much else
- "Cartesian dualism" - God has created two kinds of fundamental reality in the universe
	- "thinking substance"
	- "extended substance"
- made mathematics reign supreme

## 33. The Road to Newton: The Law of Universal Gravitation

### Scientific Advances

botany, anatomy, chemistry, astronomy, physics

### The Scientific Revolution: Copernicus to Galileo

Nicholas Copernicus
- *On the Revolutions of the Heavenly Orbs*, published in 1543 after his death
- held sun to be the center of the solar system and fixed stars, and the earth was one of the planets revolving in space around it
- heliocentric theory
- upheaved Ptolemaic system

John Kepler (1571-1630), German
- built upon the exact observations of Tycho Brahe
- orbits of the planets were ellipses
- showed that there was no discrepancy between observations and mathematical models, but didn't know why

Galileo (1564-1642)
- 1609: built a telescope
- concluded that the moon, sun, and stars were not luminous objects
- found mathematical laws describing the movement of bodies on the earth
- study of motion on bodies (dynamics)
- F=ma

### The Achievement of Newton: The Promise of Science

Newton (1642-1727)
- *Mathematical Principles of Natural Philosophy* - 1687
	- all matter moved as if every particle attracted every other particle with a force proportional to the product of the two masses and inversely proportional to the square of the distance between them (universal gravitation)
	- consistency w/ Copernicus, Kepler, and Galileo's theories
- organized + institutionalized pursuits of natural knowledge 
	- Royal Society of London, 1662
	- Royal Academy of Sciences in France, 1666

invention of calculus
- firearms

steam engine
- Robert Boyle, discoverer of "Boyle's Law"

### The Scientific Revolution and the World of Thought

everything seemed possible to the human reason
- less feeling of dependency on God
- reinforced old philosophy of natural law, or orderliness in the world
- hoped to make society also fulfill the rule of law

## 34. New Knowledge of Man and Society

discovery and exploration of the world overseas
- expansion
- realize different cultures + races

### The Current of Skepticism

harder to believe in the rightness of one's own ways b/c of the realization of human differences

skepticism: holding that all beliefs are relative
- Pierre Bayle (1647-1706) - influenced by scientific discoveries 

comets
- Edmund Halley - Halley's Comet
- Bayle's *Thoughts on the Comet*
- Bayle's *Historical and Critical Dictionary*

### The New Sense of Evidence

people looked for understanding instead of belief, generally
- wanted a new means of finding the truth
- new sense of evidence:
	- law
		- English law of evidence
		- judge lost his power of discretion in dciding what should constitute evidence
	- put to the end of delusions of witchcraft 
- questions on legal torture

### History and Historical Scholarship

skepticism of history, stricter sense of evidence
- primary sources: written documents
- paleography - deciphering, reading, dating, and authentication of manuscripts
- chronology - the age of the world and with finding a common denominator between the dating systems of various peoples

the Gregorian calendar was only gradually accepted by the continent
- sign of growing unity in world civilization

### The Questioning of Traditional Beliefs

skepticism threw doubt on the Christian religion

Richard Simon, French priest, 1678 - *Critical History of the Old Testament*

Baruch Spinoza (1632-1677) - philosophy holding that God had no existence apart from the world, that everything was itself an aspect of God
- pantheism
- considered by many to be atheistic
- denied the inspiration of the Bible, dsbelieved in miracles and the supernatural, rejected all revelation and revealed religion

John Locke (1632-1704)
- summarized many intellectual trends
- combined practical experience and theoretical interests
- educated in medicine, associated with great Whig noblemen
- wrote on finance, economics, education, religious policy, political theory, general philosophy
- *Letter on Toelration* (1689) 
	- advocated an established church
	- toleration of all but Roman Catholics and atheists
- *Reasonableness of Christianity*
	- argued that Christianity is a reasonable form of religion
	- softened fricton between religion and natural knowledge
	- shut out the supernatural
- *Essay Concerning the Human Understanding* (1690)
	- is it possible to know anything with certainty
	- true knowledge is derived from experience
	- empirical philosophy


## 23. Three Aging Empires (don't need to know?)

Holy Roman Empire, Republic of Poland, empire of the Ottoman Turks
- central authority weak
- lacked efficient systems of administraiton and government
- out of date by newer types of state
	- ex. France
- diverse of ethnic/language groups that never combined

### HRE after 1648

Voltaire: neither holy, Roman, nor an empire

too lazy lol

## 24. The Formation of an Austrian Monarchy

### The Recovery and Growth of Habsburg Power, 1648-1740

previously relied on the HRE and the more wealthy HAbsburgs of Spain, but in the 17th century, these two supports collapseee d 
- Thirty Years' War
- Spain's decline

Austria emerged from the husk of the HRE, building its own empire
- "hereditary provinces": Upper and Lower Austria, plus adjoining Tyrol, Styria, Cairinthia, and Carniola
- kingdom of Bohemia: Bohemia, Moravia, and Silesia
- kingdom of Hungary: Hungary, Transylvania, and Croatia
	- historically occupied by the Turks, who sieged Vienna
	- Habsburgs obtained the services of Prince Eugene of Savoy, who was French by origin and education, and the founder of the modern Austrian state
	- Eugene won the battle of Zenta, driving the Turks out of Hungary
- only the Austrian Habsburg dynasty held these together
- they entered the War of the Spanish Succession to win the Spanish crown, but they only ended up annexing the old Spanish Netherlands and Milan and Naples
- captured Belgrade
- developed a seaport at Trieste to open a window on the Mediterranean

### The Austrian Monarchy by 1740

an empire of the middle of the Danube with its headquarters at Vienna in Austria proper, but possessing the sizable kingdoms of Hungary and Bohemia, and so filling the basin enclosed by the Alpine, Bohemian, and Carpathian mountain systems
- made enemies of all Protestants
- denounced as tyrannical
- first international empire, based on a cosmopolitan aristocracy of landowners who felt closer to each other than to the laboring masses
- old diets remained in Bohemia, Hungary, and Austria
- no diet created for the empire as a whole
- Habsburgs determiend to make their new empire unmistakably hereditary and Catholic
	- Ferdinand II abrogated the elective Bohemian monarchy and declared it hereditary while pouring Catholic missionaries into the country
- in Hungary, where each magnate possessed the right to reform religion on his own estates, they repressed Protestantism, which they feared as pro-Turkish
	- elective monarchy done away with it
	- hereditary crown of the Habsburgs
	- lost their constitutional right of armed rebellion
	- rebellion against the HAbsburgs broke out in 1703, led by Prince Francis Rakoczy
	- Hungary remained a distinct kingdom and the magnates of Hungary remained the most free-handed aristocracy in Europe, except for the Poles
- each country retained its own law, diet , and political life
- Austrian monarchy remained a collection of territories held together by a personal union
- all crowns had to be inherited by the same pereson for the empire to exist
- Charles VI, the king-archduke after the reconquest of Hungary: Pragmatic Sanction, 1713
	- every diet in the empire and the various archdukes of the HAbsbuurg family were to agree to regard the HAbsburg territories as indivisible and to recognize only one specified line of heirs
	- urgent b/c Charles only had a daughter, Maria Theresa, and the direct male line of the Austrian Habsburgs was about to become extinct
	- achieved at the cost of many damaging concessoins i.e. the abandonment of the revival of Belgian commerce for Britain to sign
	- helped spark the War of Austrian Succession

after Charles VI died, a great war broke out to partition the Austrian empire

## 25. The Formation of Prussia

characteristic that very small states could play an influential part in European affairs
- armies small and weapons were simple 
	- difficulty of supply and communications, lack of maps, absence of general staffs + adminsitrative and technical difficulties

### Sweden's Short-Lived Empire

produced a line of extraordinary rulers
- genius in Gustavus Adolphus (1611-1632)
- brilliantly erratic Queen Christina (1632-1654)
- amazing military exploits of Charles XII (1697-1718)
- elective Swedish kingship made hereditary, royal power freed from control by the estates 
- Charles XII: won victories over Denmark, Poland, and Russia but refused to make peace
	- ultimately ruined by the Russians
	- spent yearrs as a guest and protege of the Turks
	- after his death, the Swedish sphere contracted to itself and it transitioned from the role of a great powe to that of a small one

### The Territorial Growth of Brandenburg-Prussia

Prussia became famous for its militarism
- uninviting country, thinly populated, poor soil and without mineral esources
- founded to fight the battles of the HRE against the heathen Slavs
- Elector of Brandenburg: one of the seven pinces who elected the holy Roman Emperor
	- after 1415, always of the Hohenzollern family
- Prussia formed part of the lands of the Teutonic Knights
- totally enclosed by the Polish kingdom

1618: the Elector of Brandenburg inherited the duchy of Prussia


at the Peace of Westphalia, the Elector of Brandenburg received eastern/Farther Pomerania, connecting Brandenburg with the Baltic
- also received the bishopric of Halberstadt and Magdeburg, which lay on the west bank of the Elb

Hohenzollerns dreamt of joining it to the duchy of Prussia through absorbing the intermediate Slavic Pomerelia, which was part of Poland
- accomplished in 1772
- called East Prussia; old Pomerelia was West Prussia; Prussia referred to all their provinces

they also inherited the small state of Cleves on the Rhine at the Dutch border and a few other small territories in western Gemrany separated from the main mass around Brandenburg by intermediate German principalities
- gave them a direct contact with the more advanced regions of western Europe and a base from which larger holdings in the Rhineland were eventually to be built up

dominions in three disconnected masses
- Brandenburg, with adjoining Pomerania and Elbe bishoprics
- detached eastern mass in ducal Pruissia 
- small detached western mass on and near the Rhine
- middle and western in the HRE
- the eastern was otuside the Empire and until 1660 a fief of Poland

Frederick William, 1640, in the midst of the Thirty Years' War: succeeded these diverse possessions
- Great Elector
- first of kings of Prussia
- idea of conserving an effective army and gain their ends by diplomatic maneuver
- sided with France against the Habsburgs, or with Sweden against Poland
- aspired to the title of king

1701: Habsburg emperor requested Frederick III to support him with 8k troops to enter the War of the Spanish Succession
- price was to be named as king in Prussia, which then became king of Prussia
- King Frederick I of Prussia

### The Prussian Military State

the government, to maintain the army, ahd to direct and plan the life of the country for this purpose
- unique because of the disproportion between the size of the army and its resources
- army older than the Prussian state

in Prussia, the rulers drew half their income from the crown domain and only half from taxes
- rulers used their income almost entirely for state purposes
- to maintain an army they had to make the domain more productive and find a new income derived from taxes
- army collected the taxes and determined the purposes for which the funds should be spent
- productive and technical skills had to be imported from the West
- civilian middle class remained submissive and it became the policy of the rulers to absorb practically the whole landed aristocracy, the Junkers, into military serrvice
- "all Prussian" psychology
- sense of service to the king or state
- emphasis on duty, obedience, service, and sacrifice
- repressed estates or parliamentary assemblages in which the landed aristocracy was the main element
- promised squires commission in the army and a free hand over their peasants
- serfdom spread in Prussia
- believed Junkers made better army officers b/c they werre used to commanding
- forbade the sale of manors to non nobles to preserve the officer class
	- froze classes
- middle class was not wealthy

Frederick William I, king from 1713-1740
- disdained culture, cut the expense of the royal household by 3/4
- first Prussian king to appear always in uniform
- invented a new system of recruiting (canton system) - each regiment had a particular district or canton assigned to it as a source of soldiers
- doubled size of army from 40k -> 83k

Frederick II the Great, became king in 1740
- snuck into Silesia after Charles VI of Austrria died and his daughter, Maria Theesa, inherited the throne

## 26. The "Westernizing of Russia"

debate over the degree to which Russia has been Europeanized

lacked natural frontiers, state arose as a means of supporting a modern army, government developed autocratically in conjunction with a landlord class that was impressed in state service and held the peasantry in serfdom

- no commercial class of any importance

main purpose of the westernizers was to obtain scientific, technical, and military knowledge from the West to strengthen their own country

### Russia before Peter the Great

Russia was a medley of people distinguished by their language (Slavic family)
- energy directed principally eastward
- conquered the Volga Tartars in the 16th century, reaching the Ural mountains
- Muscovite pioneers, settlers, and townbuilders
- settlements extended across northern Asia
- Europe in the rear
- long estrangement from Europe and its long association with the people of Asia
- lacked the Enlightenment and science of Europe
- but European in that it possessed a variant of manorial and feudal systems, felt the same wave of constitutional crises that was sweeping over Europe at the same time, rudiments of a national assembly corresponding to meetings of the estates in Western Europe, question of whether power should rermain in the hands of these bodies or become concentrated in the hands of the ruler

monarchy followed the pattern of contemporary europe
- sinking of peasantry into an abyss of helpless serfdom

church - ended up a department of the tsardom
- Russias set up an indepednent Russian patriarch of their own after the Turks conquered Constantinople
- Russian patriarch undertook church reforms in the 1650s (opposing Greeks)
- church officials opposed modernization coming in from western Europe
- Peter the Great: the Holy Synod, a committee of bishops
	- civil official called the Procurator of the Holy Synod, task was to see that the church did nothing displeasing to the tsar
	- secularized the church and made himself its head
	- followed general pattern of Europe

### Peter the Great: Foreign Affairs and Territorial Expansion

mixed with the west
- recruited experts in Europe for service in Russia
- cared nothing for the civilization of Europe except as a means to an end, to create an army and a state which could stand against those of the west
- aim was in part defensive, to ward off the Poles, Swedes, and Turks who had long pushed against Russia
- in part expansionist, to obtain seaports (windows on the West) on the Baltic and Black seas

Poles receding danger because of the growing anarchy in Poland

Turks slowly stopped expanding but still remained obstinate foes

Sweden was Russia's main enemy
- Peter entered an alliance with Poland and Denmark to partition the overseas possessions of the Swedish house
- Charles XII fought but then got distracted forcing the Poles to elect the Swedish candidate as their king
- ultimately worn down by the Russian winter and the Swedish army was destroyed, the king and a few hundred fugitives escaping across the Turkish frontier

army transformed into a professional force
- rebellion of the streltsi in 1698, Peter executed them and rebuilt the army from the ground up

Russian empire held together by military might

established St. Peteresburg in the territory conquered from the Swedes
- a symbol of the new Russia
- more a city than Louis' spectacular creation at Versailles
- Moscow was the stronghold of opposition to his westernizing program

### Internal Changes under Peter the Great

taxes imposed on virtually everything, and the tax burden fell mainly on the peasants
- led to further restriction on the mobility of the peasants to assure payment of taxes
- serfdom became more onerous and moer nearly universal

Peter adopted mercantilist policies
- encouraged exports
- built a fleet on the Baltic
- developed mining, metallurgy, and textiles
- organized commercial companies and funded them with government funds, gave them a labor supply by assigning them serfs in a given locality

serfdom began to spread as an industrial institution also
- serf owners obtained the right to sell serfs without land
- industry developed on the basis of unfree labor
- economic system rested largely on the impressment of both management and labor, in contrast to the private profit and wages in the capitalistic West 
- Peter's efforts to force Russia to a European level of material productivity widened the gap between Russia and western Europe

new administrative system to operate this system of tax colleting, recruiting, economic controls, serf hunting, and represssion of internal rebellion
- "senate" dependent on himself
- ten "governments" / *gubernii* - Latin and imitation of the West
- ruled the church through his Procurator of the Holy Synod
- ahe, an absolute ruler, stood at the top
- abolished the rule of hereditary succession, claiming the right for each tsar to name his own successor
- transmission of supreme power outside the domain of law
- centralized absolutism lacked legal regularity and was imposed on a tubulent and largely unwilling population

state without a people

state service - virtually all landowning and serf-owning aristocrats were required to serve in the army or civil administration
- birth counted for nothing

he wanted to reeducate his people in the new ways

revolutionist

aggressively secular

### The Results of Peter's Revolution

some adhered strictly to the old ways, others thought Petere was moving too fast and too indiscriminately toward the new

many resented the presence of foreigners who looked downn on them as savages and enjoyed special privileges

Peter put his own son to death after he declared that after he became tsar he would put a stop to the innovations

upper-class Russians became more Europeanized, but Peter never truly reached the lower classes

violent paradoxes set up by rapid Europeanization

## 27. The Partitions of Poland

Polish royal elections subject to international influence
- Germans
- France (Louis XV)
- Habsburgs (Maria Theresa)
- Russia (Catherine II), established a Russian puppet

Prussians wanted to partition Poland and join the old duchy of Prrussia with Brandenburg-Pomerania in one continuous territory

1772: war between Russia and Turkey

Prussian proposal to prevent an Austro-Russian war and to peserve the balance in eastern Europe by leaving the Ottoman Empier more or less intact, annex terrritory from Poland instead

Poland's fist patition in 1772
- Russia took an esatern slice around Vitebsk
- Austria took a southern slice, Galicia
- Prussia took the Pomerelian borderland in West Prrussia

Poles renewed their efforts at a national revival, but it lacked deeper strength because it was confined mainly to the nobles
- serf population didn't really care

Fou Years' Diet, beginning in 1788: refomr party gathered strength
- new constitution in 1791
- made Polish kingship hereditary, strengthening the executive government, and rreduced the powers of the great magnates while giving political rights to many burghers in the towns
- but governments of eastern Europe were afraid of the French Revolution, so they were denounced
- Russian tsarina sent an army into Poland and destroyed the constitution

in agreement with Prussia, she carred out the Second Partition

1794: Thaddeus Kosciuszko led a more revolutionary attempt, but it was cushed

a Third Partition then divided what remained of the country between Russia and Austria

Poland ceased to exist

the act was lauded as a diplomatic achievement and because it put to end an old cause of international rivalry and war, rerplacing anarchy with solid government

alarming that Poland was partitioned without a war
- showed that it was dangerous not to be strong while Great Powers were rising
- partition of Poland changed the balance of Europe as a whole
	- blow to France who had used it as an outpost of French influence in the East

## 29. The Global Economy of the Eighteenth Centuy

### Commerce and Industry in the Eighteenth Century

increase of wealth brought about by the methods of commercial capitalism and handicraft industry
- older merchant capitalism, domestic industry, and mercantilist government policies

agriculture was the greatest single industry and source of wealth
- but people were also engaged in manufactures
	- weaving and processing of woolens
	- paper, glass, porrcelain, silk, linen, cloth

urbanization was no sign of economic advancement

although foreign and colonial trade grew rapidly, domestic or internal trade was greater in volume and occupied more people in France and Great Britain
- GB had no internal tariffs and an insigifnicant guild system and no monopolies
- France had Colbert's Five Great Farms with a great internal market

### The World Economy: The Dutch, British, and French

Dutch shipping
- middlemen and common carriers for other people
- grew rich on imports and lived on their investments
- Dutch capital found everywhere

East India companies were established
- English and French East India companies were reorganized with an increased investment of capital, and a numberr of others were established, but they all failed except the Danish company which had lasted 60 years

British and French won out in the commercial rivalry of the 18th century
- high level of industrial production at home
- governments organized on a national scale and able to protect and advance the interests of their merchants in distant countries under mecantilist pinciples

### Asia, America, and Africa in the Global Economy

Europeans wanted a lot frrom Asia, but Asians wanted almost nothing from Europe
- drain of Gold from Europe to Asia
	- British found a supply in Africa along the Gulf of Guinea, the Gold Coast

europeans wanted spices (largely brought in by the Dutch from the East India islands) and manufactured goods, because Asia was superior to Europe in technical skill

American trade based largely on sugar
- a new economic system, the plantation, arose in just a few decades
- West Indies
- richest of all sugar colonies, San Domingo (Haiti), belonged to France

Dutch traders landed in Virginia in 1619, a year before the arrival of the Pilgrims in Massachusetts
- slavery in the Americas before 1650 was occasional
- plantation economy arose after 1650 and especially after 1700

transatlantic slave trade in the 18th century conducted mainly by English-speaking interests

Russia wanted Western manufactures and colonial products

### The Wealth of Western Europe: Social Consequences

the wealth was produced by a combination of all continents; the europeans simply directed the movement
- supplied capital
- contributed technical and organizing abilities
- their demand fueled the trade

new wealth owned by private people/capitalism
- governments became dependent on these private owners of property because governments derived much income from loans and taxes

merchants bought landed and mixed with the old landed nobility 

## 30. Western Europe after Utrecht, 1713-1740

after the Peace of Utrecht, while the Bourbon Philip V sat on the Spanish throne, the Spanish holdings were partitioned

Spanish officials followed the absolutist government of Louis XIV as a model
- nothing changed much in substance
- old machinery functioned with more precision

Dutch after Utrecht receded from the political stage, and the Swiss became important in banking and financial circles with the Dutch

the Belgians founded an overseas trading company, which soon came to an end due to the jealousy of the Dutch and British, leading to the Austrian emperor withdrawing his support

### France and Britain after 1713

in both countries
- king was peresonally ineffective, so the various popertied interests gained many advantages
- both countries enjoyed commercial expansion
- went through a short period of financial experimentation and frantic speculation in stocks, the bubble bursting in 1720
- afterwards, governed by a statesman
	- Cardinal Fleury in France
	- Robert Walpole in England
	- keep peace abroad and conciliate all interests at home

France: king was a child, Louis XV, great-grandson of Louis XIV and only 5 years old when he began to reign in 1715
- government entrusted to a regent, the Duke of Orleans
- aristocracy gained a greater share of power
- judges of parlements bought or inherited their seats and became almost entirely nobles and couldn't be removed by the king
- much influence was conceded to the Parlement of Paris

GB: British aristocracy more politically competent than the noblesse of France
- Parliament effective for conducting public business
- House of Lords was hereditary, but the House of Commons was a mixing pot of ideas
- main question was whether the principles of the Revolution of 1688 should be maintained


Whig:
- government, Anglican bishops close to the government

Tories:
- men who were remote from the central governmetn or suspicious of its activities

Non-Jurors: 
- group of Anglican clergy who refused the oath of loyalty after 1688
- kept alive a shadow church until 1805

Stuarts: after 1701, when James II died in France, his son, James III, schemed to make himself king of England
- partisans: Jacobites, from Jacobus, Latin for James
- Jacobites felt that if he gave up Catholicism, he should be accepted as Britain's rightful king
- theory of divine right
- Whigs couldn't tolerate a return of the Stuarts b/c it would undo the principles of the Glorious Revolution

Jacobite uprising

### "The Bubbles"

"South Sea bubble" in England

"Mississippi bubble" in France

## 31. The Great War of the Mid-Eighteenth Century: The Peace of Paris, 1763

War of the Austrian Succession and the Seven Years' War
- duel of Britain and France for colonies, tarde, and sea power
- duel of Prussia and Austria for territory and military power in central Europe

### Eighteenth-Century Warfare

war was slow, formal, elaborate, and indecisive

little national feeling, or feeling of any kind

war was between governments, o rbetween the oligarchies and aristocracies which governments represented

civilians were little affected - never had war been so harmless

peace was almost eas easy to make as war
- saw a series of wars and treaties and rearrangements of alliances, all arising over the same issues with exactly the same powers present at the end as at the beginning

### The War of Austiran Succession, 1740-1748

started by the king of Prussia, Frederick II the Great
- decided to conquer Silesia, so on December 16, 1740, he invaded it
	- belonged to the kingdom of Bohemia and hence to the Habsburgs
	- the Pragmatic Sanction, a general agreement signed by the European powers, including Prussia, had stipulated that all domains of the Austrian Habsburgs should be inherited integrally by the new heiress, Maria Theresa
	- his attacking Silesia could invoke nothing beteter than "reason of state", the welfare and expansion of the state of which he was ruler
	- Pragmatic Sanction universally disregarded

Maria Theresa was one of the most capable rulesr ever produced by the house of Habsburg
- devout
- reconstructed her empire and accomplished more than brilliant contemporaries with more spectacular projects of reform

when Frederick invaded, she went to Hungary to crown herself with the crown of St. Stephen, and the Hungarian magnates pledged their "blood and life" and delivered 100,000 soldiers

reminiscent of the struggles of the times of Louis XIV or the Thirty Years' War
- civil struggle within the Holy Roman Empire, plus Prussia
- collision of Bourbons and Habsburgs, where French pursued their policy of maintaining division in Germany by supporting the German princes against the Habsburgs, plus Spain
- Maria supported only by Britain and Holland

1742: Maria Theresa forced to accept the proposals of Frederick for a separate peace, temporarily granting him Silesia as he temporarily stepped out of the war
- French and Bavarians organized a puppet kingdom in Bohemia
- 1745: French dominated Belgium

America captured the French fortress of Louisburg on Cape Breton Island with the British navy; British warships drove french and Spanish shipping from the seas; the French West Indies were blockaded
- French gov announced its willingness to negotiate

peace at Aix-la-Chapelle in 1748
- Anglo-French agreement
- return to the status quo ante bellum
- British returned Louisburg despite the protests of the Americans and relaxed their stranglehold on the Caribbean
- French returned Madras and gave up their hold on Belgium
- frecognized Frederick's annexation of Silesia and required Maria Theresa to cede some Italian duchies to a Spanish Bourbon
- Belgium returned to Maria Theresa at the insistence of Britain and the Dutch
- Maria Theresa and her minsiters wer edissatisfied
- the war proved the weakness of the French position because they were vulnerable at land and at sea
- the Habsburg empire still stood; Hungary thrown in its lot with Vienna; Bohemia was won back

Maria Theresa got her husband elected HRE when Charles VI died

loss of Silesia was massive

German dualism: two great powers known as "Germany": Austria and Prussia
- transfer of Silesia made the Habsburg empire less German and more Slavic/Hungarian/international

"reversal of alliances" and Diplomatic Revolution of 1756
- alliance proposed between Austria and France

when the Seven Years' War broke out in 1756, GB + Prussia vs. Austria + France
- Austria had concluded a treaty with the Russian empire for the annihilation of Prussia

### The Seven Years' War, 1756-1763: In Europe and America

Seven Years' War began in America

Austria, Russia, and France set out to partition Prussia 
- but with his persistence, Frederick ultimately triumphed because the coalition tended to fall apart
- French lacked enthusiasm because they were fighting Britain and the Austrian alliance was unpopular and Kaunitz wouldn't plainly promise them Belgium
- Russians alarmed Austrian allies the further west they moved
- so Frederick only needed to deal with the Austrians
- by the peace of Hubertusburg in 1763, he lost nothing and retained Silesia

Seven Years' War was a phase in the long dispute between France and Great Britain
- supremacy in the growing world economy, control of colonies, command of the sea
- on the American mainland, the French had more territory, the British had more people

British ultimately triumphed over France

### The Seven Years' War, 1756-1763: In India

triumph of British over French ambitions in the east
- British sea power
- British government had no intention of conquest in India

defeated, France made an alliance with Spain, but the British also defeated Spain

### The Peace Settlement of 1763

France ceded to Britain all French territory on the North American mainland east of the Mississippi, so Canada became British 

to Spain, France ceded all holdings west of the Mississippi and its mouth

so France abandoned North America

in exchange, France retained many economically more valuable establishments elsewhere
- France received back Guadeloupe and Martinique, as well as most of its slave stations in Africa
- in India, they remained in possesssion of their commercial installations at Pondicherry and other towns
- forbidden to erect fortifications or pursue political ambitions among Indian principles, which the French didn't want to pursue either

cemented dualism of Germany, although Prussia emerged stronger than ever

while the British overwhelmingly won over France, France suffered no commercial calamity, while the war opened up new commercial channels for England

## 35. Political Theory: The School of Natural Law

### Natrual Right and Natural Law

political theory didn't embrace the cynicism attributed to Machiavelli nor did it fall into the skepticism of those who said that the customs of one's country should be passively accepted, or that one form of government was about as good as another

Question: what is right?
- natural right / natural law

right is "natural," not a mere human invention - we detect unfairness and injustice by comparing laws to natural law
- right and law exist outside and above all peoples, universal and same for all
- a good king or a just people are those whose actions correspond to the objective standard
- we discover natural law by reason

some tried to create an international law of a "law of nations"
- sovereign states, though bound by no positive law of authority, should work together for the ocmmon good
- principles of international law remained those of natural law

### Hobbes and Locke

forms of a government were a means to an end - the state had to be justified, morally
- absolutism: divine right of kings
- constitutionalism: heritage/custom, charters/bulls/compacts of former times and historic powers of parliaments and estates
- both pointed back to liberties of the Middle Ages, and so were unsatisfactory

Hobbes justified absolutism
- concluded that men have no capacity for self-government
- sided with English king against Parliament
- people agered to a "contract" by which they surrendered their freedom of action into the hands of a ruler, who necessarily had absolute power to maintain order
- *Leviathan* 
- absolute powerwas an expedient to promote individual welfare; originated in a free and rational agreement by which people accepted it

John Locke justified constitutionalism
- *Two Treatises of Government*
- agreed that government was based on a kind of contract, but he sided with Parliament
- more genial view of human nature than Hobbes
- believed that a moderate religion was a good thing
- people could learn from experience and could be edcuated to an enlightened way of life, favoring a belief in self-government
- right to life, liberty, and property
- the contract is not unconditional, like Hobbes says, but it imposes mutual obligations
- only rational and responsible creatures can exercise true freedom
