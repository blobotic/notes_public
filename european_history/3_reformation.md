[Top](#unit-3-reformation)

Three streams:
- the laboring poor
	- dissatisfaction with the bishops and aboots of the church being part of a wealthy and oppressive ruling class
	- great peasant rebellion in Germany in the 1520s
	- Anabaptists - modern Baptists, Mennonites, Moravian Brothers are their descendents

	- disputes with the church, wanted to be the master in their own territory
	- rulers determined which religions would prevail
		- Lutheran and Anglican churches
		- to some extent, the Gallican church (French branch of the Roman Catholic church)
- by 1600, the 2nd and 3rd had won many successes, but the first was suppressed

Protestants were religious "revolutionaries" 
- thought that the abuses of the church must be corrected, but also that the Roman church was wrong in principle
- hoped that "popery" would fall, while the upholders of the old order worked to annihilate or reconvert heretics
- the religious frontier first appeared as early as 1560
- not generally accepted until after the Thirty Years' War

### Luther and Lutheranism

Martin Luther 
- an earnest monk until he was 40
- terrified by the thought of the awful omnipotence of God and his own weakness, and suffered from his chronic conviction that he was damned
- unsatisfied with the church's offerings for salvation: sacraments, prayer, attendance at Mass
- doctrine of justification by faith alone
- good works were the consequence and external evidence of inner grace, but not the cause
- 1517: Tetzel, a friar, was traveling through Germany distributing indulgences, authorized by the pope to finance the building of St. Peter's in Rome
	- Luther nailed his 95 theses to the door of the castle church at Wittenburg
	- reviewed the Catholic sacrament of penance
	- after confession, the sinner is freed of his burden by inner grace and faith alone, not by the priest's absolution
	- priesthood was unneccessary
	- appealed to Pope Leo X to correct the abuse of indulgences
	- when he refused action, Luther urged the assembly of a general church council
	- but when he had to confess that councils could be mistaken, he iconcluded that there was no true authority to define true Christian belief
	- individuals could read the Bible and form their own interpretation
- 1519 and 1520: rallied public opinion in a series of tracks

- Lutheranism / anti-Romanism swept over Germany
	- a league of imperial knights adopting Lutheranism attacked their neighbors, the church-states of the Rhineland
	- 1524: peasants revolted, stirred by new religious ideas (anyone could see for themselves what was right), but with social/economic aims 
		- regulation of rents, security of common village rights, ceasure of exactions and oppressive rule by their manorial overlords
		- Luther rejected all connection to peasants
		- while they were put down, popular unrest continued to stir the country
		- Anabaptists - various leaders and their followings
			- world needed love
			- Christ would soon come again
			- some claimed they were saints and could do no wrong
			- some required baptism as adults
	- 1534: obscure zealots convered in Munster, proclaiming the reign of the saints, abolishing property and introducing polygamy

		- Luther advised his followers to join with Catholics to repress this menace
		- after a year, Munster was relieved, the saints rooted out, and John of Leyden died in torture
	- horrified by how religious revolution became confused with social revolution, defined his position more conservatively
		- restricted the right of private judgment in matters of conscience
		- larger place for an established clergy, although Lutheranized
		- submissiveness to the state - Christian liberty was only an internal freedom
	- Charles V, the Holy Roman Emperor, had to repress Luther and uphold Catholicism because religion gave the Holy Empire meaning
		- states of the Empire saw his efforts as a threat to their own freedom
		- imperial free cities and the dynastic states of north Germany insisted on the right to determine their own religion, the *ius reformandi*
		- states became Lutheran and "secularized" (confiscated) church properties, enriching Lutheran princes
		- most church-states didn't secularize, but in a territory in East Prussia that belonged to the Teutonic order, its leader, Albert of Brandenburg, declared in 1525 for Luther and converted East Prussia into a secular duchy and became a hereditary duke
		- League of Schmalkad: a group of Lutheran princes and free cities
			- king of France, Francis I, although Catholic, allied with the League because of political interests
		- to find a compromise for this religious disagreemnt, Charles appealed to the pope to assemble a Europe-wide council
			- the king of France schemed to prevent the pope from calling a council
			- kings of France and England urged national councils instead to compromise on a local basis
			- papacy feared a council of all Latin Christendom, since both Catholics and Protestants demanded reform, so they stalled
		- 1548: desperate, Charles issued the *Interim*, a guide to religion in Germany until a church council could complete its work
			- upheld Catholic doctrines but gave concessions such as marriage of the clergy to attract the Protestants 
			- rejected by both Catholics and Protestants

			- *cuius regio eius religio*: each state could choose to be Lutheran or Catholic
			- no individual freedom of religion was permitted
			- Ecclesiastical Reservation: any Catholic bishop turned Lutheran should do it individually and leave his land and its inhabitants Christian, although it was often disregarded since the issues in Germany were still unstable
			- Lutheranism prevailed in the north and in the south in the duchy of Wurttemberg and various Lutheranized free cities
			- Catholicism prevailed elsewhere in the south, in the Rhine valley, and in the direct possessions of the house of Habsburg (up to the Netherlands)
		- Germany was the only large European people to emerge from the religious conflict almost evenly divided between Catholic and Protestant
- Lutheranism adopted by the kings of Denmark and Sweden as early as the 1520s
- it was too closely associated with established states to spread easily as an international movement

### Calvin and Calvinism 

Jean Calvin, born Jean Cauvin, called himself Calvinus in Latin, born 1509 and trained as a priest and a lawyer
- at age 24, after experiencing a sudden conversion, he joined forces with Luther
- 3 years later, in 1536: published his *Institutes of the Christian Religion* in Latin
	- addressed to the world
	- appeal to human reason, writing in the severe, logical style of trained lawyers
	- dissatisfied people in all countries could find expression of universal propositions
- agreed with Luther's criticisms of the Roman church and his idea of justification by faith
- while Calvin also rejected transubstantiation, Luther insisted on consubstantiation, while Calvin regarded it as a pious act of symbolic or commemorative character
- two main differences between Calvin and Luther
	- Calvin was a strong proponent of predestination
		- the "elect"/"godly" were chosen with no merit on their own for salvation
		- a sense of burning conviction of being on the side of the Almighty
		- Calvinists were militant, uncompromising, perfectionist, and resolute
		- Puritan (England)
	- Calvinists refused to recognize the subordination of church to state or the right of any government to lay down laws for religion
		- true Christians (the elect) should Christianize the state
		- remake society into the image of a religious community
		- rejected bishops
		- church should be governed by presbyteries, elected bodies made up of ministers and devout laymen
		- broke monopoly of priestly power, promoting secularization, despite them being the opposite of secular in their desire to Christianize all society
- Calvin set up his model Christian community at Geneva in Switzerland
	- body of minsiters ruled the church
	- strict rules and severe worship, appealing to the intellectual rather than the emotional
	- worship became more solemn and subdued, and more strictly regulated by the Bible
	- rejected those more radical than him: Michael Servetus, a Spanish refugee who denied the Trinity, sought asylum and was pronounced a heretic and burned at the stake
- Calvinism was adopted widely as reformers of all nationalities flocked to Geneva and little groups found Calvin's *Institutes* reasonable
	- Hungary and Bohemia: large elements turned Protestant and usually Calvinist, opposing Habsburg rule
	- Poland: many Calvanists, Anabaptists, and Unitarians (Socinians) (denied the Trinity)
	- Germany: disliked by both the Lutheran and Catholic churches because the opposed them as ungodly impositions of worldly power
	- France: Huguenots were Calvinist
	- Netherlands: Protestants were Catholic
	- Scotland: John Knox in the 1550s brought Calvinism here, Presbyterianism became the established religion
	- Calvinism spread to England and then to British America, giving birth to the Presbyterian and Congregationalist churches of the United States
- Calvinist had a largely aristocratic outlook, but they began developing democracy
	- never venerated state
	- self-government: "covenenats" and the election of presbyteries
	- refused hereditary authority through bishops/kings
- except in Geneva, Calvinists remained in opposition to the established authorities of church and state

### The Reformation in England

its government broke with the Roman church before adopting Protestant principles
- Henry VIII (1509-1547) prided himself on his orthodoxy
	- *Defense of the Seven Sacrments* in refutation of Luther's ideas
	- the grateful pope conferred upon him the title of "Defender of the Faith"
	- no male heir, so he requested the pope annul his existing marriage to Catherine of Aragon
	- while in the past, popes had obliged, the pope couldn't offend Catherine because she was the aunt of the Emperor Charles V
	- Henry put in a new archbishop of Canterbury, rejected Rome, and married Anne Boleyn
	- 3 years later, he put to death Anne and then married 4 more wives for a total of 6
	- acted through Parliament because he believed that a king was strongest when united with the representatives of his kingdom
	- 1534: Parliament passed the Act of Supremacy, declaring the English king to be the "Protector and Only Supreme HEad of the Church and Clergy of England"
		- Sir Thomas More, author of *Utopia*, was executed for treason for refusing this oath
	- closed all the monasteries in England and redistributed them to followers, strengthening a landed aristocracy that had weakened in the Wars of the Roses
	- didn't want to change the doctrines, only to be the supreme head of an English Catholic church
	- many people began favoring ideas of Continental Reformers
	- after Henry died in 1547, his 10 year old son, Edward VI, succeeded him, and the Protestant party came to the fore
	- 1553: Edward died and was succeeded by his half-sister Mary, daughter of Catherine of Aragon and a devout Roman Catholic
		- she tried to re-Catholicize England, but made it more unpopular
		- 1554: she married Philip of Spain, whom the English detested along with his Spanish Catholicism
		- she burned 300 people at the stake, horrifying people
	- 1558: Elizabeth, daughter of Anne Boleyn, succeeded Mary
		- hid her views but could not be Roman Catholic because she was illegitimate and so unable to be a queen
		- England became Protestant under her rule
		- Church of England resembled a Lutheran church organizationally as a state church which maintained the physical possessions, buildings, and internal organization of the medieval church along with the episcopal courts
		- religiously, it was Protestant: English replaced Latin as the lingua franca, no cult of the saints, clergy married
		- except for episcopacy, the matter of church government through bishops, Anglican belief had large Catholic influences
		- regarded Lutherans as "semipapist" and felt a divide with Rome, the seat of "popery"
		- still emphasized the Catholic rather than the Protestant character of Anglicanism
- the Church of Ireland, a replica of the Church of England, was established in Ireland
	- discontent, the Irish became more attached to the Roman church

### The Religious Situation by 1560

by 1560, while no religious issues had been settled, the chief Protestant doctrines had been affirmed, Latin Christendom was disintegrating
- all Protestants rejected papal authority and the special/sacerdotal/supernatural character or priesthood
	- revolution against the medeival position of the clergy
	- called clergy ministers, not priests
	- clergy could marry, no monks/nuns/friars
- none participated in any effective international organization
- all Protestant churches replaced Latin with the vernacular (English/French/German/Czech)
- all reduced the number of sacraments to 2 or 3, which they regarded more as symbols than carriers of divine grace
- all believed in justification by faith
- all denied transubstantiation
- all gave up on the obligatory confessional, priestly absolution, and purgatory
- one tru source of Christian belief was the Holy Scripture
- allowed no individual freedom in doctrine but allowed the right of private judgment in matters of conscience

economic motivations:
- Protestant England and Holland underwent a rapid capitalistic development
- Protestant governemtns confiscated church lands
- economic conditions far less decisive than religious convictions/political scircumstances
