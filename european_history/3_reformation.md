- faith vs good deeds for salvation
	- Luther had suffered anguish about his unworthiness before God before being enlightened that his salvation came not from his good works but as a gift from God due to Luther's faith in Jesus Christ
		- argued that pious acts didn't lead to salvation
		- faith alone could achieve salvation
	- Catholic position - Council of Trent (1545-1563) - clarified that the justification came not only through faith, but through hope and love by obeying God's commandments and doing good deeds

	- Luther argued that the litearl text of the Scripture was the foundation of Christian truth, not the teaching of popes/councils
	- clergy didn't hold any power beyond that of the laity
	- all believers were priests
	- clergy's special privileges were unjustified

### 4. The German Peasants' Revolt

knights revolted against their lords in 1523 and were quickly crushed

a more widespread peasant revolt followed in 1525 accompanied by some sympathetic rebellions among lower-class artisanns and laborers
- quickly crushed because of lack of effective training and leadership
- hoped that Luther would endorse their revolt, but he detested social revolution and believed that subjects had to obey state authority because it was ordained by God
	- preoccupied with attaining salvation through faith

The Twelve Articles - 1524, a manifesto drawn up by leaders of the peasants in Swabia in southwestern Germany
- Luther criticized the Twelve Articles
	- viewed them as an egalitarian social revolution threatening society's hierarchical order and the legitimat property rights of the lords and clergy

	- "thinking with the Church" 


### 9. The Catholic Response to Protestant Reforms

general admission that a new general council of the church was necessary to clarify and affirm Catholic doctrine and institute reforms

Popes delayed, fearing for their authority, but in 1545, in the Alpine city of Trent between Germany and Italy, the council convened
- papacy in control
- no Protestant theologians present
- suspended suveral times (longest hiatus 10 years: 1552-1562)
- ended in 1563

	- raise standards of morality and learning among bishops and clergy
- official catechism outlining the orthodox beliefs of the Roman church
- established seminaries to direct the education of future clergy
- increased bishop's repsonsibilities for the pastoral life of his diocese

## 9. The Protestant Reformation
[Top](#unit-3-reformation)

Three streams:
- the laboring poor
	- dissatisfaction with the bishops and aboots of the church being part of a wealthy and oppressive ruling class
	- great peasant rebellion in Germany in the 1520s
	- Anabaptists - modern Baptists, Mennonites, Moravian Brothers are their descendents
- middle classes of various European cities, especially those which were more autonomous
	- wanted to manage their own religious affairs
	- believed church too embedded in a feudal, baronial, and monarchical system
- kings and ruling princes
	- disputes with the church, wanted to be the master in their own territory
	- rulers determined which religions would prevail
		- Lutheran and Anglican churches
		- to some extent, the Gallican church (French branch of the Roman Catholic church)
- by 1600, the 2nd and 3rd had won many successes, but the first was suppressed

Protestants were religious "revolutionaries" 
- thought that the abuses of the church must be corrected, but also that the Roman church was wrong in principle
- hoped that "popery" would fall, while the upholders of the old order worked to annihilate or reconvert heretics
- the religious frontier first appeared as early as 1560
- not generally accepted until after the Thirty Years' War

### Luther and Lutheranism

Martin Luther 
- an earnest monk until he was 40
- terrified by the thought of the awful omnipotence of God and his own weakness, and suffered from his chronic conviction that he was damned
- unsatisfied with the church's offerings for salvation: sacraments, prayer, attendance at Mass
- doctrine of justification by faith alone
- good works were the consequence and external evidence of inner grace, but not the cause
- 1517: Tetzel, a friar, was traveling through Germany distributing indulgences, authorized by the pope to finance the building of St. Peter's in Rome
	- Luther nailed his 95 theses to the door of the castle church at Wittenburg
	- reviewed the Catholic sacrament of penance
	- after confession, the sinner is freed of his burden by inner grace and faith alone, not by the priest's absolution
	- priesthood was unneccessary
	- appealed to Pope Leo X to correct the abuse of indulgences
	- when he refused action, Luther urged the assembly of a general church council
	- but when he had to confess that councils could be mistaken, he iconcluded that there was no true authority to define true Christian belief
	- individuals could read the Bible and form their own interpretation
- 1519 and 1520: rallied public opinion in a series of tracks
	- clergy was no different from the laity
	- urged people to find Christian truth in the Bible for themselves
	- denounced reliance on fasts, pilgrimages, saints, and MAsses
	- rejected purgatory
	- reduced seven sacraments to baptism and communion (Mass) (repudiated transubstantiation)
	- invited the state to assume control over religion
- papal bull: excommunication unless he recanted
	- Luther burned the bull
	- summoned to appear before a diet of the Empire at Worms in the Rhineland
	- banned from the Empire
	- received protection under the Elector of Saxony and other north German princes
	- in seclusion, he began translating the Bible into German
- Lutheranism / anti-Romanism swept over Germany
	- a league of imperial knights adopting Lutheranism attacked their neighbors, the church-states of the Rhineland
	- 1524: peasants revolted, stirred by new religious ideas (anyone could see for themselves what was right), but with social/economic aims 
		- regulation of rents, security of common village rights, ceasure of exactions and oppressive rule by their manorial overlords
		- Luther rejected all connection to peasants
		- while they were put down, popular unrest continued to stir the country
		- Anabaptists - various leaders and their followings
			- world needed love
			- Christ would soon come again
			- some claimed they were saints and could do no wrong
			- some required baptism as adults
	- 1534: obscure zealots convered in Munster, proclaiming the reign of the saints, abolishing property and introducing polygamy
		- John of Leyden, a Dutch tailor, ruled with the "authority of God"
		- Luther advised his followers to join with Catholics to repress this menace
		- after a year, Munster was relieved, the saints rooted out, and John of Leyden died in torture
	- horrified by how religious revolution became confused with social revolution, defined his position more conservatively
		- restricted the right of private judgment in matters of conscience
		- larger place for an established clergy, although Lutheranized
		- submissiveness to the state - Christian liberty was only an internal freedom
	- Charles V, the Holy Roman Emperor, had to repress Luther and uphold Catholicism because religion gave the Holy Empire meaning
		- states of the Empire saw his efforts as a threat to their own freedom
		- imperial free cities and the dynastic states of north Germany insisted on the right to determine their own religion, the *ius reformandi*
		- states became Lutheran and "secularized" (confiscated) church properties, enriching Lutheran princes
		- most church-states didn't secularize, but in a territory in East Prussia that belonged to the Teutonic order, its leader, Albert of Brandenburg, declared in 1525 for Luther and converted East Prussia into a secular duchy and became a hereditary duke
		- League of Schmalkad: a group of Lutheran princes and free cities
			- king of France, Francis I, although Catholic, allied with the League because of political interests
		- to find a compromise for this religious disagreemnt, Charles appealed to the pope to assemble a Europe-wide council
			- the king of France schemed to prevent the pope from calling a council
			- kings of France and England urged national councils instead to compromise on a local basis
			- papacy feared a council of all Latin Christendom, since both Catholics and Protestants demanded reform, so they stalled
		- 1548: desperate, Charles issued the *Interim*, a guide to religion in Germany until a church council could complete its work
			- upheld Catholic doctrines but gave concessions such as marriage of the clergy to attract the Protestants 
			- rejected by both Catholics and Protestants
		- 1546: Schmalkaldic League, allied with France, went to war with the emperor
		- 1555: war ended by the Peace of Augsburg
			- victory for Lutheranism and states' rights
			- *cuius regio eius religio*: each state could choose to be Lutheran or Catholic
			- no individual freedom of religion was permitted
			- Ecclesiastical Reservation: any Catholic bishop turned Lutheran should do it individually and leave his land and its inhabitants Christian, although it was often disregarded since the issues in Germany were still unstable
			- Lutheranism prevailed in the north and in the south in the duchy of Wurttemberg and various Lutheranized free cities
			- Catholicism prevailed elsewhere in the south, in the Rhine valley, and in the direct possessions of the house of Habsburg (up to the Netherlands)
		- Germany was the only large European people to emerge from the religious conflict almost evenly divided between Catholic and Protestant
- Lutheranism adopted by the kings of Denmark and Sweden as early as the 1520s
- it was too closely associated with established states to spread easily as an international movement

### Calvin and Calvinism 

Jean Calvin, born Jean Cauvin, called himself Calvinus in Latin, born 1509 and trained as a priest and a lawyer
- at age 24, after experiencing a sudden conversion, he joined forces with Luther
- 3 years later, in 1536: published his *Institutes of the Christian Religion* in Latin
	- addressed to the world
	- appeal to human reason, writing in the severe, logical style of trained lawyers
	- dissatisfied people in all countries could find expression of universal propositions
- agreed with Luther's criticisms of the Roman church and his idea of justification by faith
- while Calvin also rejected transubstantiation, Luther insisted on consubstantiation, while Calvin regarded it as a pious act of symbolic or commemorative character
- two main differences between Calvin and Luther
	- Calvin was a strong proponent of predestination
		- the "elect"/"godly" were chosen with no merit on their own for salvation
		- a sense of burning conviction of being on the side of the Almighty
		- Calvinists were militant, uncompromising, perfectionist, and resolute
		- Puritan (England)
	- Calvinists refused to recognize the subordination of church to state or the right of any government to lay down laws for religion
		- true Christians (the elect) should Christianize the state
		- remake society into the image of a religious community
		- rejected bishops
		- church should be governed by presbyteries, elected bodies made up of ministers and devout laymen
		- broke monopoly of priestly power, promoting secularization, despite them being the opposite of secular in their desire to Christianize all society
- Calvin set up his model Christian community at Geneva in Switzerland
	- body of minsiters ruled the church
	- strict rules and severe worship, appealing to the intellectual rather than the emotional
	- worship became more solemn and subdued, and more strictly regulated by the Bible
	- rejected those more radical than him: Michael Servetus, a Spanish refugee who denied the Trinity, sought asylum and was pronounced a heretic and burned at the stake
- Calvinism was adopted widely as reformers of all nationalities flocked to Geneva and little groups found Calvin's *Institutes* reasonable
	- Hungary and Bohemia: large elements turned Protestant and usually Calvinist, opposing Habsburg rule
	- Poland: many Calvanists, Anabaptists, and Unitarians (Socinians) (denied the Trinity)
	- Germany: disliked by both the Lutheran and Catholic churches because the opposed them as ungodly impositions of worldly power
	- France: Huguenots were Calvinist
	- Netherlands: Protestants were Catholic
	- Scotland: John Knox in the 1550s brought Calvinism here, Presbyterianism became the established religion
	- Calvinism spread to England and then to British America, giving birth to the Presbyterian and Congregationalist churches of the United States
- Calvinist had a largely aristocratic outlook, but they began developing democracy
	- never venerated state
	- self-government: "covenenats" and the election of presbyteries
	- refused hereditary authority through bishops/kings
- except in Geneva, Calvinists remained in opposition to the established authorities of church and state

### The Reformation in England

its government broke with the Roman church before adopting Protestant principles
- Henry VIII (1509-1547) prided himself on his orthodoxy
	- *Defense of the Seven Sacrments* in refutation of Luther's ideas
	- the grateful pope conferred upon him the title of "Defender of the Faith"
	- no male heir, so he requested the pope annul his existing marriage to Catherine of Aragon
	- while in the past, popes had obliged, the pope couldn't offend Catherine because she was the aunt of the Emperor Charles V
	- Henry put in a new archbishop of Canterbury, rejected Rome, and married Anne Boleyn
	- 3 years later, he put to death Anne and then married 4 more wives for a total of 6
	- acted through Parliament because he believed that a king was strongest when united with the representatives of his kingdom
	- 1534: Parliament passed the Act of Supremacy, declaring the English king to be the "Protector and Only Supreme HEad of the Church and Clergy of England"
		- Sir Thomas More, author of *Utopia*, was executed for treason for refusing this oath
	- closed all the monasteries in England and redistributed them to followers, strengthening a landed aristocracy that had weakened in the Wars of the Roses
	- didn't want to change the doctrines, only to be the supreme head of an English Catholic church
	- many people began favoring ideas of Continental Reformers
	- after Henry died in 1547, his 10 year old son, Edward VI, succeeded him, and the Protestant party came to the fore
	- 1553: Edward died and was succeeded by his half-sister Mary, daughter of Catherine of Aragon and a devout Roman Catholic
		- she tried to re-Catholicize England, but made it more unpopular
		- 1554: she married Philip of Spain, whom the English detested along with his Spanish Catholicism
		- she burned 300 people at the stake, horrifying people
	- 1558: Elizabeth, daughter of Anne Boleyn, succeeded Mary
		- hid her views but could not be Roman Catholic because she was illegitimate and so unable to be a queen
		- England became Protestant under her rule
		- Church of England resembled a Lutheran church organizationally as a state church which maintained the physical possessions, buildings, and internal organization of the medieval church along with the episcopal courts
		- religiously, it was Protestant: English replaced Latin as the lingua franca, no cult of the saints, clergy married
		- except for episcopacy, the matter of church government through bishops, Anglican belief had large Catholic influences
		- regarded Lutherans as "semipapist" and felt a divide with Rome, the seat of "popery"
		- still emphasized the Catholic rather than the Protestant character of Anglicanism
- the Church of Ireland, a replica of the Church of England, was established in Ireland
	- discontent, the Irish became more attached to the Roman church

### The Religious Situation by 1560

by 1560, while no religious issues had been settled, the chief Protestant doctrines had been affirmed, Latin Christendom was disintegrating
- all Protestants rejected papal authority and the special/sacerdotal/supernatural character or priesthood
	- revolution against the medeival position of the clergy
	- called clergy ministers, not priests
	- clergy could marry, no monks/nuns/friars
- none participated in any effective international organization
- all Protestant churches replaced Latin with the vernacular (English/French/German/Czech)
- all reduced the number of sacraments to 2 or 3, which they regarded more as symbols than carriers of divine grace
- all believed in justification by faith
- all denied transubstantiation
- all gave up on the obligatory confessional, priestly absolution, and purgatory
- one tru source of Christian belief was the Holy Scripture
- allowed no individual freedom in doctrine but allowed the right of private judgment in matters of conscience

economic motivations:
- Protestant England and Holland underwent a rapid capitalistic development
- Protestant governemtns confiscated church lands
- economic conditions far less decisive than religious convictions/political scircumstances

## 10. Catholicism Reformed and Reorganized
[Top](#unit-3-reformation)

Counter Reformation / Catholic Reformation
- Catholic church underwent a genuine reform that may have occurred without Protestantism stimulus
- decisions made and measures adopted responded explicitly to the Protestant challenge

demand for reform expressed itself in the demand for a general church council
- king of France and the Holy Roman Emperor jointly convened a council at Pisa in 1511 to force reforms upon Pope Julius II and if necessary depose him
	- no delegates from other countries
	- lacked moral authority and accomplished nothing
- in response, the pope assembled the Fifth Lateran Council at Rome in 1512
	- few took it serious because it composed mainly of Italian prelates
- after the Lutheran upheaval, Charles V tried to persuade the pope to assmeble a council to fix the abuses of the church to destroy the basis of conversion
	- French king, Francis I (1515-1547) supported the pope because he obtained control over the Gallican church via the Concordat of Bologna of 1516
	- and he opposed Charles V because his territories (Germany, Netherlands, Spain, much of Italy) encircled and thus threatened France with "universal monarchy"
	- so he actively encouraged Protestants and dissuaded the calling of a council
- a council was finally convened in 1537 after a party of reforming cardinals arose
	- war between France and the HRE forced its abandonment
	- 1545: the council of Trent assembled and began operations
		- 1545-1547
		- 1551-1552
		- 1562-1563

### The Council of Trent

poorly attended
- the Fourth Lateran Council of 1215 and at Constance in 1415, 500+ prelates assembled
- attendance at Trent was lesserand sometimes fell as low as 20-30
- the decree on Luther's "justification", on which a number of Catholics had believed compromise was possible, was passed at a session where only 60 prelates were present
- the most regular were the Italian and Spanish
- much fewer French and Germans
- conciliar movement: a party of bishops believed that the collective power of bishops from all parts of the Catholic world constituted a greater authority than the pope

popes triumphed and the council voted that no act of the council should be valid unless accepted by the Holy See
- centralizing element rather than national triumphed
- after 1563, no coiuncil met again until the Vatican Council of 1870 where papal infallibility was proclaimed
- so the council of Trent preserved the papacy as a center of unity for the Catholic church and prevented its dissolutions into state churches
- gradual success b/c secular rulers still only accepted what they wanted

no concessions
- justification was by works and faith combined
- enumerated and defined the seven sacraments, the vehicles of grace independent of the spiritual state of those who received them
- priesthood was a special estate set apart from the laity by the sacrament o f holy orders
- procedures of confessional and of absolution clarified
- transubstantiation reaffirmed
- Scripture and tradition were both equally sources of Catholic faith 
	- rejected Protestant claim that true faith came from the Bible alone 
	- Vulgate, St. Jerome's Latin translation from the 4th century, was the only version on which authoritative teaching could be based
- Latin language of religious worship
- celibacy and monstacism upheld
- existence of purgatory reaffirmed
- theory and correct practice of indulgences restated
- veneration of saints, cult of hte Virgin, idolatry (images, relics, pilgrimages) = spiritually useful and pious actions

reform of moanstic orders
- bishops should reside within dioceses and attend more carefully their proper duties
- gave bishops more administrative control over clergy who were previously exempt from episcopal jurisdiction
- pluralism (one man held numerous church offices at the same time) was checked
- educate clergy (seminaries set up) to ensure competency

### The Counter crusade

Renaissance popes were succeeded by a line of reforming popes
- first: Paul III (1534-1549)
- they insisted on the primacy of the papal office, and in contrast to their predecessors, they regarded it as a moral and religious force

rise religious seriousness
- bishops, on their own initiatve, became more strict
- Catholic religious sense centered in a reverence of the sacraments and the church itself
- new religious orders
	- Jesuits
	- Oratorians (men)
	- Ursulines (women)
	- dedicated themselves to educational and philanthropic activities
	- missionary fervor (Asia and Americas) (the poor)

Spain
- never taken by the Renaissance, so this is where the new Catholic feeling first developed
- St. Ignatius Loyola (1491-1556) was from Spain and founded the Jesuits after a religiou experience/conversion
	- authorized by Paul III in 1540
	- monastic order of a new type, more directed toward active participation in the affairs of the world
	- arduous mystical training - defined in Loyola's *Spiritual Exercises*
	- order ruled by an iron discipline and the belief of the infallibility of one's superior and the Holy Church
	- otherwise favored rationality and a measure of liberty in the religious life
	- most famous schoolmasters in Catholic Europe for 200 years (Latin classics were the main substance of adolescent education)
	- work among the ruling classes (confessors of kings)
	- their ultramonatism (high papalism) irritated both Catholics and Protestants alike

counteroffensive against Protestantism sparked by the deepening of religious life
- Jesuits = international missionary force
	- poured into the most divisive regions
	- overthrew heretic monarchs
	- reconverted people
- all countries censored books, both Protestant and Catholic
	- the papal Index of Prohibited Books
- all countries (both Protestant and Catholic) set up judicial and police machinery to enforce conformity to the accepted church
	- Elizbeth in England: High Commission to bring recusants into the Church of England
	- all bishops could enforce their episcopal courts
	- Inquisition was the most severe
		- Spanish Inquisition, established in 1480 to ferret out JEwish and Muslim survivals in Spain
			- introduced into all countries ruled by the Spanish crown (Spanish Netherlands, an important  center of Calvinism) and employed against Protestantism
		- Roman/papal Inquisition, established at Rome in 1542 under the Holy Office, a permanent committee of cardinals
			- revival of the famous medieval tribunal established in the 13th century
		- torture
		- heresy regarded as the supreme crime
		- in theory offered a court to protect the purity of faith, but most Catholic countries rejected both Inquisitions

people converted to the faith of their governments
- 1560: the strongest powers of Europe (Spain, France, Austria) were all officially Catholic
- Protestant states all small/middle-sized
- Luther states of Germany were individually of little weight
- Scandinavian monarchies far away
- England was the most prominent Protestant kingdom still without a colonial empire and a hostile Scotland to the north
- had a great combined Catholic crusade ever developed, Protestantism could have been wiped out, but it never succeeded
