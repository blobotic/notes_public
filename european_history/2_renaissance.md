## 6. The Renaissance in Italy
[Top](#unit-2-renaissance)

Renaissance: "rebirth"
- after a period of interruption, the Middle Ages, men now resumed a civilization like that of the Greco-Romans
- concept of "modern" and "ancient" times arose, separated by the Middle Ages
- a new era in thought and feeling
- modern natural science is traced back to medieval universities
- Italy of the Quattrocento (15th century): other fields of thought and expression
	- this influence remained strong in other countries for 200+ years
	- high culture (literature and the arts)
- where an almost purely secular attitude first appeared
	- life no longer a brief preparation for the afterlife

### The Italian Cities and the New Conception of Life

the towns of Italy were the richest of those that arose in Europe in the Middle Ages
- pursuit of refined trades: goldsmith or stonecarver
- delight in the beautiful became common in all classes
- merchants made fortunes in commerce and as bankerse
	- lent money to popes or princes
	- rejoiced in the beautiful things money could buy\
	- secular: forgot what couldn't be bought

towns were independent city-states
- no king, and popes were absent or otherwise engaged
- merchant oligarchies
	- Milan: succumbed to a local prince/despot
	- Florence, Venice, Genoa: governed themselves as republics
- Florence, chief city of Tuscany, was particularly so
	- population of 60,000 (moderately large)
	- many gifted men in a short period: Dante, Petrarch, Boccaccio, Machiavelli
	- many leading figures of the Renaissance were Florentines
	- ruled by the Medici family, founded by Giovanni (d. 1429), a merchant and banker of Florence
		- son, Cosimo de' Medici (1389-1464) found allies and became an unofficial ruler
		- Cosimo's grandson, Lorenzo the Magnificent (1449-1492) governed but was remembered as a poet, connoisseur, and lavish benefactor of art and learning
		- 16th century: Tuscany became a grand duchy, Medici family hereditary grand dukes
		- 1737: Medici family died out
		- many cardinals and two popes to the church, and two queens of France

new conception of life
- spiritual world unneeded because of the excitement of the real world
- difficult to believe that the clergy were superior 
- a sense of the vast range of human powers, in contrast to the frailness and need of God's salvation of the past
- instead of poverty and renunciation being respected, people praised proper enjoyment of wealth
- "The whole glory of man lies in activity." - Leonardo Bruni (1433)
- new civic consciousness and a sense of public duty
	- referenced writings of Cicero and other ancients (ethics independent of Christian and medieval tradition)
- little attention to public responsibility, cult of the great individual
- emphasis on outstanding attainments; the great individual shaped his own destiny in a world governed by fortune
	- virtu: the quality of being a man (vir, "man")
		- women could also exhibit virtu
		- successful demonstration of human powers
		- a man who knew what he was doing and made the best use of his opportunities, excelling at everything he did
- arts and architecture reflected an increasing worldliness: it was a function of the arts to convey a reality and objectiveness, but also to be idealized by the artist's individual feeling
- architecture diverged from the Gothic cathedrals of the Middle Ages
	- architects preferred Greco-Roman principles of design (symmetrical arrangements of doors and windows, the classical column, the arch and the dome)
	- more publics nonreligious buildings were built
	- town houses built by wealthy merchants
	- gardens and terraces
- sculpture emerged as an independent and free-standing art
	- primarily human beings so people could walk around and see it from all angles
	- Greek/Roman tradition
	- busts, use of the nude
- painting more conservative
	- few ancient paintings were known during the Renaissance
	- oil paint
	- remained conservative, religious themes
	- conception and presentation were new: introduction of the mathematics of perspective
	- to tell a story
	- became less symbolic and more a portrayal of concrete realities, with distinct individuals and expressions (increased focus on human subjects)
- while the main tone of the arts in Renaissance Italy was to take satisfaction in beauty and to present the world as desirable, clear-cut, lucid, and finite, many Florentines were troubled by the wordliness and paganism that had grown, leading to a movement for religious reforms
	- led by priest Savanarola, who was tried and burned at the stake in 1498

### Humanism: The Birth of "Literature"

litterae humanoires: rising interest in humane letters
- most writing in the Middle Ages were technical (theology, philosophy, law, histories, descriptions) (hymns, songs, plays)
- Italian humanists wrote much in Latin, but differed from earlier literate people in that they were largely not members of the clergy
	- complained that Latin had become monkish, barbaric, and "scholastic"
	- preferred the style, interests, and sensibility of the Greeks and Romans
	- failure of understanding between the "two cultures": people of humanistic interests and those of more scientific concerns
	- sensed a relevancy in the ancients and classics
	- humanists polished their Latin and learned Greek, searching for new classical texts
- most of the humanists also wrote in Italian, although Latin had a certain dignity
	- led to Florentine becoming the standard form of modern Italian 
	- first time a European vernacular became standardized and adopted into the complexities of a written language
	- French and English followed soon after; other languages took longer
- Francesco Petrarca, Petrarch: Florentine exile, son of a merchant
	- disdained the law and the clergy as too "scholastic"
	- loved life, love, beauty, travel, and connections and spurned the ephermeral and deceptive
	- loved Cicero for his common sense and commitment to political liberty
	- loved St. Augustine for his otherworldy vision of the City of God
		- also found religious concern in Cicero and St. Augustine's writing
	- wrote sonnets in Italian, an epic in Latin, an introspective study of himself, and many letters
	- aspired to literary fame
- Boccaccio, his contemporary and a Florentine, wrote the *Decameron* in Italian
- they were followed by the main group of humanists
- humanist Coluccio Salutati became chancellor of Florence in 1375
	- glorified Florence as a new civic consciousness arose because of the threat of the ambitious Milan
	- succeeded by two other humanists, Bruni and Poggio
		- Bruni wrote a history of Florence (new achievement in historical writing) with a flowing narrative form
		- history took on the function of heightening collective civic  consciousness
- new critical attitude
	- new sense of a need for authentic sources (shown by Bruni)
	- Lorenzo Valla became a founder of textual criticism
		- showed that the Donation of Constantine was a forgery
- Pico della Mirandola and others looked for aspects of truth not revealed in the Christian Scriptures

### Schooling and Manners
- the Renaissance introduced the idea of separating students by age groups of levels of accomplishment into separate classes in separate rooms with different teachers
- periodic promotion of the pupil from one level to the next
- Latin remained the principal subject, but Greek was now added
	- new purposes: skills in the use of language, rhetoric, to read the ancient writings
- etiquette and personal style were studied
	- Castiglione's *Book of the Courtier*, one of many books of etiquette (behavior suited to princely courts)
	- certain considerations for the feelings of others

### Politics and the Italian Renaissance
- Italian Renaissance produced no institution/great idea akin to the Roman Church, which had fallen into ruin
- no development of effectual political institutions
	- Florence turned from a high-spirited republicanism to acceptance of one-man rule
- politics became a tangled web of subterfuge and conspiracy: "Italian cunning"
	- Medici dukes in Florence
	- Sforza dukes in Milan
	- narrow oligarchies ruled Venice and Genoa
- Niccolo Machiavelli, *The Prince* (1513) - dreamed of the citizens of Italy uniting under patriotism, found his heroes in the kings Ferdinand of Aragon, Louis XI of France, and Henry VII of England
	- emancipated politics from theology and moreal philosophy
	- effective rulers and governments act only in their own political interest
	- while bad, it was how successful rulers behaved
	- considered unduly cynical
	- politics become increasingly secular
- in contrast to the New Monarchies in which the rulers enjoyed a spontaneous loyalty from their people, Italy was politically helpless
	- 1494: a French army crossed the Alps and France and Spain contended for Italy
	- 1527: a horde of Spanish and German mercenaries sacked Rome
	- the Renaissance faded away
	- Italy remained politically divided for the next 300 years
	- its culture permeated the rest of Europe


## 7. The Renaissance outside Italy
[Top](#unit-2-renaissance)

The northern Renaissance was characterized by a more gradual change with a strong religious focus and a blend of the old and the new, and developments in some cases (Flemish painters) exceeded Italy

### Religious Scholarship and Science

"pagan" humanism of Italy and the Christian humanism of the north
- Christian humanists studied the Hebrew and Greek texts of the Bible and read the Latin and Greek Church Fathers 
	- deepen understanding of Christianity
	- restore moral vitality
- universities remained places of pedantic, monkish, and "scholastic" learning
	- continuing foundation of universities (continued medieval intellectual interests), in contrast to Italy in the 15th century, where no universities were established

Germany, before the commerce shift from central Europe to the Atlnatic seaboard, was a center of European life
- politically ill-defined
- flourished economically; towns traded and German banking families (i.e. Fugger) controlled the greatest amount of wealth in Europe
- technical inventiveness
- mining developing
- Gutenberg in Mainz in the Rhineland produced the first books printed with movable type in 1450
- Flemish masters of painting on the western fringe of Germany, and Durer and the Holbeins in south Germany
- Latinizing of Germany names - Germany also shared Latin culture
- Regiomontanus (Johann Muller) (1436-1476)
	- mathematical conception of the universe
	- most influential scientist of the 15th century
	- Leonardo da Vinci's scientific labors unknown
- Nicholas of Cusa (1401-1464), Rhineland, churchman
	- mystical philosophy turned into mathematics and science
- Copernicus (Niklas Koppernigk) (1473-1543), mixed German-Polish region of East Prussia
	- earth moved about the sun

- Paracelsus (Hohenheim) revolutionized medicine at the University of Basel
- Dr. Faustus 
	- rumored to have sold his soul to the devil for knowledge and power
	- dramatized later
	- Oswald Spengler's *Decline of the West* in 1918: called European society "Faustian"
- idea of human powers to understand and control physical nature
	- similar to Italy's idea of humanity's limitless potential
	- emancipation of humanity's limitless potentialities
	- the two ideas constituted the new Renaissance spirit

### Mysticism and Lay Religion

Italy: religion became aesthetic

north: religion took on a more mystical and soberly moral tone
- Nicholas of Cusa - mystic tendencies
- Mesiter Eckhart (d. 1327)
- Thomas a Kempis 9d. 1471), *Imitation of Christ*
- mysticism: belief/experience that the individual soul could in perfect solitude commune directly with God
	- accepted the church but offered a deeper religion in which the church had no place
	- transcended all social institutions 
	- Martin Luther later drew from this
	- as a consequence, people who would've been clergy in the Middle Ages remained laymen, and church reformers now came from outside the church

Lay religion in the Netherlands
- George Groote, a lay preacher, gave sermons on spiritual regeneration
- 1374: founded a religious sisterhood, the Sisters and Brothers of the Common Life, which eventually received papal approval
- lived communually but not as monks/nuns (far more freedom)
- worked in relieving the poor and teaching, focusing on the Christian ideal of character and conduct
- Modern Devotion: spread widely in the Netherlrands and adjoining parts of Germany

### Erasmus of Rotterdam

Erasmus of Rotterdam (1466-1536), the most notable figure of the humanist movement
- like all the humanists, he wrote in a "purified" and intricate Latin style
- disdained the Middle Ages and studied the classical writers of antiquity
	- indifferent to hard questions of serious philosophy
	- feared the unenlightened excitability of common people
	- unpolitical
	- didn't think in terms of worldly power or advantage
	- need of reform of the clergy, but put his faith into education, enlightened discussion, and gradual moral improvement
- *Praise of Folly*: satirized worldly pretensions and ambitions, particularly those of the clergy
- *Handbook of a Christian Knight*: balance between worldly affairs and remaining a devout Christian
- "Erasmian virtues" - mildness, reasonableness, tolerance, love of peace, critical and reforming zeal, etc
- never questioned the essence of the Roman Catholic church, only attacked the abuses in the church by the clergy


## 8. The New Monarchies
[Top](#unit-2-renaissance)

New Monarchs
- middle of the 15th century: war, civil war, class war, feudal rebellion, banditry
	- formless violence weakened central governments
- "New Monarchs" tried to impose a civil peace
	- not really new because they resumed the interrupted labors of kings in the High Middle Ages
	- foundation for national/territorial states
- monarchy as an institution was a guarantee of law and order
- proclaimed that hereditary monarchy was the legitimate form of public power
	- support of middle-class people in towns, tired of the private wars and marauding habits of feudal nobles
	- willing to let parliaments be dominated/ignored by the king because parliaments were often filled with unruly barons or had accentuated class conflict
- king organized armies with taxes to control the nobles
	- pike + longbow let foot soldiers stand against horsemen
	- foot soldiers were far cheaper
- used Roman law (studied in universities) to break down the feudal "common" law
	- king = "sovereign", addressed as "majesty"
	- king incorporated the will and welfare of the people in his own person
	- *salus populi suprema lex* - "the welfare of the people is the highest law"
	- king could make law
	- *quod principi placuit legis habiet vigorem* - "what pleases the prince has the force of law"

### The New Monarchy in England, France, and Spain

England: New Monarchy arrived with the dynasty of the Tudors (1485-1603)
- Henry VII (1485-1509), first king, gained the throne by force and put an end to the civil turbulence of the Wars of the Roses
	- great English baronial had weakened each other
	- passed laws against "livery and maintenance", aka private armies
	- used his royal council as a new court, which met in the Star Chamber 
		- represented the authority of the king and his council
		- no jury
		- later denounced as an instrument of despotism
		- initially accepted because it preserved law and order

France: New Monarchy represented by Louis XI (1461-1483) of the Valoid line and his successors
- royal domain expanded around Paris
- Louis XI rounded out French borders, built up a royal army, suppressed brigands, and suppressed rebellious nobles
- power to raise taxes without parliamentary consent
	- Estates General of France met only once during his reign
	- there, they requested the king govern without them
- after 1516, the kings of France controlled their own national clergy (why they were never tempted to turn Protestant)
	- 1516: King Francis I reached an agreement with Pope Leo X, the Concordat of Bologna, to rescind the Pragmatic Sanction, which gave councils greater independence and power 
	- pope received annates, king appointed bishops and abbots

Spain: Aragon and Castile
- Aragon: Balearic Islands, Sardinia, Sicily, Naples
- Castile (after 1492): Americas
- both joined after the marriage of Ferdinand of Aragon and Isabella of Castile in 1469, but neither adopted a common political, judicial, or administrative institution
- the common feeling was belonging to the Spanish Catholic church, rather than a sense of Spanish national identity
- Cardinal Ximenes, shortly before 1500, managed to rid the church in Spain of the abuses and inertia which debilitated the church in the rest of Europe, completing the *reconquista*
	- 1492: Granada conquered from the Moors, adding to the heterogeneous character of the spanish dominions
- thus, unification took place around the church
	- rulers worked through facilities offered by the church, most notably the Inquisition
	- insisted on religious conformity
	- "Spanishness" = sense of Catholicism
	- in contrast to the prior tolerantness, the expelled the Jews and the Moors in 1492
	- false Christians became common, families that had been Muslim (Moriscos) or Jewish (Marranos) but had accepted Christianity to avoid expulsion
	- fear that they retained a sympathy for the religion of their forbears, and so they were brought before the Inquisition to extort confessions
	- spanish life became rigidly and ostentatiously orthodox
	- safest to be profuse in one's external devotions
	- fused the national and the Catholic
- Spain remained a great crusade

### The Holy Roman Empire and the Habsburg Supremacy

HRE had three states: 
- the princely states 
	- duchies, magraviates, etc
	- hereditary, like Saxony, Brandenburg, Bavaria
	- New Monarchy primarily successful in hereditary princely states, which began taking on the semblance of modern states
- the ecclesiastical states
	- bishoprics, abbacies, etc
	- bishop/abbot conducted the government, nonhereditary
- imperial free cities
	- around 50
	- dominated the commercial and financial life of the country
- also thousands of imperial knights
	- noblemen of minor consequence who possessed few manors 
	- recognized the supremacy of only the emperor
- they kept the emperorship in an elective role so that local liberties could be reformed
	- Count Palatine, Duke of Saxony, Margrave of Brandenburg, King of Bohemia, archbishops of Mainz, Trier, and Cologne
	- 1452: the electors chose the Archduke of Austria to be the emperor
		- Habsburgs - managed to get themselves consistently reelected to Emperorship in almost every generation from 1452-1806
		- Habsburg emperors tried to introduce centralizing principles, but they fell flat in the face of state rights
- Charles V of the Empire (known as Charles I in Spain)
	- Maximilian of Austria married the heiress of the dukes of Burgundy, who had acquired the Netherlands and the Free County of Burgundy
	- their son, Philip, married Joanna, heiress to Ferdinand and Isabella of Spain
	- Charles was Philip and Joanna's son, combining his grandparents' inheritances and also elected Holy Roman Emperor
	- became symbolic head of Germany
	- most powerful ruler of the day
- Turks were pushing through Hungary and defeated the Hungarians at the battle of Mohacs, so in desperation, the parliaments of Hungary and Bohemia elected Charles V's brother Ferdinand as their king
	- Habsburg family entrenched in central Europe, Netherlands, Spain, Mediterranean, south Italy, America
	- no one since Charlemagne had stood so far above all rivals
	- Europe threatened with a "universal monarchy"

Causes of the religious reformation and the emergence of Protestanism
- decline of the church
- growth of secular and humanistic feeling
- spread of lay religion outside of the official clergy
- rise of monarchs who wished to control everything in their kingdoms, including the church
- resistance of feudal elemetns to these same monarchs
- lassitude of the popes and their feer of church councils
- atomistic division of Germany
- Turkish peril
- zeal of Spain
- preeminence of Charles V
- fears felt in the rest of Europe, especially France, of absorption of suffocation by the Habsburg empire
