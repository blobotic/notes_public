## 6. The Renaissance in Italy
[Top](#unit-2-renaissance)

Renaissance: "rebirth"
- after a period of interruption, the Middle Ages, men now resumed a civilization like that of the Greco-Romans
- concept of "modern" and "ancient" times arose, separated by the Middle Ages
- a new era in thought and feeling
- modern natural science is traced back to medieval universities
- Italy of the Quattrocento (15th century): other fields of thought and expression
	- this influence remained strong in other countries for 200+ years
	- high culture (literature and the arts)
- where an almost purely secular attitude first appeared
	- life no longer a brief preparation for the afterlife

### The Italian Cities and the New Conception of Life

the towns of Italy were the richest of those that arose in Europe in the Middle Ages
- pursuit of refined trades: goldsmith or stonecarver
- delight in the beautiful became common in all classes
- merchants made fortunes in commerce and as bankerse
	- lent money to popes or princes
	- rejoiced in the beautiful things money could buy\
	- secular: forgot what couldn't be bought

towns were independent city-states
- no king, and popes were absent or otherwise engaged
- merchant oligarchies
	- Milan: succumbed to a local prince/despot
	- Florence, Venice, Genoa: governed themselves as republics
- Florence, chief city of Tuscany, was particularly so
	- population of 60,000 (moderately large)
	- many gifted men in a short period: Dante, Petrarch, Boccaccio, Machiavelli
	- many leading figures of the Renaissance were Florentines
	- ruled by the Medici family, founded by Giovanni (d. 1429), a merchant and banker of Florence
		- son, Cosimo de' Medici (1389-1464) found allies and became an unofficial ruler
		- Cosimo's grandson, Lorenzo the Magnificent (1449-1492) governed but was remembered as a poet, connoisseur, and lavish benefactor of art and learning
		- 16th century: Tuscany became a grand duchy, Medici family hereditary grand dukes
		- 1737: Medici family died out
		- many cardinals and two popes to the church, and two queens of France

new conception of life
- spiritual world unneeded because of the excitement of the real world
- difficult to believe that the clergy were superior 
- a sense of the vast range of human powers, in contrast to the frailness and need of God's salvation of the past
- instead of poverty and renunciation being respected, people praised proper enjoyment of wealth
- "The whole glory of man lies in activity." - Leonardo Bruni (1433)
- new civic consciousness and a sense of public duty
	- referenced writings of Cicero and other ancients (ethics independent of Christian and medieval tradition)
- little attention to public responsibility, cult of the great individual
- emphasis on outstanding attainments; the great individual shaped his own destiny in a world governed by fortune
	- virtu: the quality of being a man (vir, "man")
		- women could also exhibit virtu
		- successful demonstration of human powers
		- a man who knew what he was doing and made the best use of his opportunities, excelling at everything he did
- arts and architecture reflected an increasing worldliness: it was a function of the arts to convey a reality and objectiveness, but also to be idealized by the artist's individual feeling
- architecture diverged from the Gothic cathedrals of the Middle Ages
	- architects preferred Greco-Roman principles of design (symmetrical arrangements of doors and windows, the classical column, the arch and the dome)
	- more publics nonreligious buildings were built
	- town houses built by wealthy merchants
	- gardens and terraces
- sculpture emerged as an independent and free-standing art
	- primarily human beings so people could walk around and see it from all angles
	- Greek/Roman tradition
	- busts, use of the nude
- painting more conservative
	- few ancient paintings were known during the Renaissance
	- oil paint
	- remained conservative, religious themes
	- conception and presentation were new: introduction of the mathematics of perspective
	- to tell a story
	- became less symbolic and more a portrayal of concrete realities, with distinct individuals and expressions (increased focus on human subjects)
- while the main tone of the arts in Renaissance Italy was to take satisfaction in beauty and to present the world as desirable, clear-cut, lucid, and finite, many Florentines were troubled by the wordliness and paganism that had grown, leading to a movement for religious reforms
	- led by priest Savanarola, who was tried and burned at the stake in 1498

### Humanism: The Birth of "Literature"

litterae humanoires: rising interest in humane letters
- most writing in the Middle Ages were technical (theology, philosophy, law, histories, descriptions) (hymns, songs, plays)
- Italian humanists wrote much in Latin, but differed from earlier literate people in that they were largely not members of the clergy
	- complained that Latin had become monkish, barbaric, and "scholastic"
	- preferred the style, interests, and sensibility of the Greeks and Romans
	- failure of understanding between the "two cultures": people of humanistic interests and those of more scientific concerns
	- sensed a relevancy in the ancients and classics
	- humanists polished their Latin and learned Greek, searching for new classical texts
- most of the humanists also wrote in Italian, although Latin had a certain dignity
	- led to Florentine becoming the standard form of modern Italian 
	- first time a European vernacular became standardized and adopted into the complexities of a written language
	- French and English followed soon after; other languages took longer
- Francesco Petrarca, Petrarch: Florentine exile, son of a merchant
	- disdained the law and the clergy as too "scholastic"
	- loved life, love, beauty, travel, and connections and spurned the ephermeral and deceptive
	- loved Cicero for his common sense and commitment to political liberty
	- loved St. Augustine for his otherworldy vision of the City of God
		- also found religious concern in Cicero and St. Augustine's writing
	- wrote sonnets in Italian, an epic in Latin, an introspective study of himself, and many letters
	- aspired to literary fame
- Boccaccio, his contemporary and a Florentine, wrote the *Decameron* in Italian
- they were followed by the main group of humanists
- humanist Coluccio Salutati became chancellor of Florence in 1375
	- glorified Florence as a new civic consciousness arose because of the threat of the ambitious Milan
	- succeeded by two other humanists, Bruni and Poggio
		- Bruni wrote a history of Florence (new achievement in historical writing) with a flowing narrative form
		- history took on the function of heightening collective civic  consciousness
- new critical attitude
	- new sense of a need for authentic sources (shown by Bruni)
	- Lorenzo Valla became a founder of textual criticism
		- showed that the Donation of Constantine was a forgery
- Pico della Mirandola and others looked for aspects of truth not revealed in the Christian Scriptures

### Schooling and Manners
- the Renaissance introduced the idea of separating students by age groups of levels of accomplishment into separate classes in separate rooms with different teachers
- periodic promotion of the pupil from one level to the next
- Latin remained the principal subject, but Greek was now added
	- new purposes: skills in the use of language, rhetoric, to read the ancient writings
- etiquette and personal style were studied
	- Castiglione's *Book of the Courtier*, one of many books of etiquette (behavior suited to princely courts)
	- certain considerations for the feelings of others

### Politics and the Italian Renaissance
- Italian Renaissance produced no institution/great idea akin to the Roman Church, which had fallen into ruin
- no development of effectual political institutions
	- Florence turned from a high-spirited republicanism to acceptance of one-man rule
- politics became a tangled web of subterfuge and conspiracy: "Italian cunning"
	- Medici dukes in Florence
	- Sforza dukes in Milan
	- narrow oligarchies ruled Venice and Genoa
- Niccolo Machiavelli, *The Prince* (1513) - dreamed of the citizens of Italy uniting under patriotism, found his heroes in the kings Ferdinand of Aragon, Louis XI of France, and Henry VII of England
	- emancipated politics from theology and moreal philosophy
	- effective rulers and governments act only in their own political interest
	- while bad, it was how successful rulers behaved
	- considered unduly cynical
	- politics become increasingly secular
- in contrast to the New Monarchies in which the rulers enjoyed a spontaneous loyalty from their people, Italy was politically helpless
	- 1494: a French army crossed the Alps and France and Spain contended for Italy
	- 1527: a horde of Spanish and German mercenaries sacked Rome
	- the Renaissance faded away
	- Italy remained politically divided for the next 300 years
	- its culture permeated the rest of Europe
