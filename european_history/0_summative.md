- Peace of Westphalia: received eastern Pomerania, connecting Brandenburg with  the Baltic

- snuck into Silesia after Charles VI of Austria died and Maria Theresa inherited the throne

**Westernizing of Russia**
- Europeanized; main purpose was to obtain scientific, technical, and military knowledge

- army into professional force (military might), fought Sweden, mercantilist policies, heavy taxes imposed, serfdom spread, new administrative system with Peter as an absolute ruler at the top, state service in army, aggressively secular
- some thought he was too radical

**Partitions of Poland**
- lauded as a diplomatic achievement and because it put to end an old cause of international rivalry war, replacing anarchy with solid government
- alarming that Poland was partitioned without a war, because it showed that it was dangerous not to be strong while Great Powers were rising
- changed balance of Europe as a whole; blow to France who had been using it as an outpost of French influence in the East

First Partition (1772)
- war between Russia and Turkey; Prussian proposal to prevent an Austro-Russian war and to preserve the balance in eastern Europe by leaving Turkey intact was to annex territory from Poland instead
- as a result, Poland renewed their efforts at a national level, but only nobles cared; serfs didn't

Four Years Diet (1788-1792) 
- reform party gathered strength, (1791) new constitution
- Polish kingship hereditary, strengthened executive government, reduced power of magnates, denounced because powers in eastern Europe were afraid of the French Revolution; Russian tsarina sent an army into Poland to destroy the constitution

Third Partition (1795)
- response to (1794) Thaddeus Kosciuszko's attempt at a revolution
- divided what remained between Russia and Austria

**War of Austrian Succession (1740-1748)**
- started by the king of Prussia, Frederick II the Great, who invaded Silesia in 1740
	- disregarded Pragmatic Sanction
- Maria Theresa was one of the most capable rulers ever produced by the house of Habsburg; she went to Hungary to crown herself, supported only by Britain and Holland
- (1742) Maria forced to accepted Frederick's proposals for a separate peace, temporarily granting him Silesia for temporarily stepping out of the war
- after the US captured a French fortress of Louisburg on Cape Breton Island with the British navy and British warships drove French and Spanish shipping from the seas and blockaded the French West Indies, the French government announced its willingness to negotiate

Peace at Aix-la-Chapelle (1748)
- Anglo-French agreement, return to the status quo
- recognized Frederick's annexation of Silesia
- Belgium returned to Maria Theresa; she and her ministers dissatisfied

- British ultimately triumphed over France

Peace Settlement of 1763
