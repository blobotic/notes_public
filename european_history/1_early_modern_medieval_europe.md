## 2. The Early Middle Ages: The Formation of Europe
[Top](#unit-1-early-modern-and-medieval-europe)

Ancient times:
- Africa was Tunisia-Algeria
- Asia was Asia Minor
- Europe wasn't referenced
Between the 5th-10th centuries, Europe emerged, defining its people as something distinct from Asia and Africa

### The Disintegration of the Roman Empire

The Roman Empire fragmented after Constantine embraced Christianity in hopes of strengthening the imperial system and founded an eastern capital in Byzantium, shifting the center of gravity eastward. 

Romans drew a line beyond which they rarely ventured and wouldn't allow the barbarians to pass, but they still filtered in
- recruited to serve in the Roman armies, after which they would receive farmlands
By the 4th/5th centuries, individuals of barbarian birth began reaching high positions of state
Simultaneously, the activity of Roman cities faltered, commerce decayed, taxes became ruinous, the army seated and unseated emperors
The West and thus Rome became indistinguishable with the barbarian world

Barbarians began to seek access to Rome, tribes of tens of thousands plundering and conquering as they went
- 380: West Goths in Constantinople
- 382: East Goths appeared in Asia Minor in 382 
- 396: West Goths tore through Greece
- 410: West Goths sacked Rome
- 429: Vandals reached Roman Africa
- 420: West Goths reached Spain
- 450: Angles and Saxons overran Britain, Franks invaded Gaul
- 450: The Huns cut through central Europe and France under Attila, the "scourge of God"
- 476: The last Roman emperor in the West was deposed by a barbarian chieftain
- 493: East Goths in Italy

- 632: after Muhammad's death, the Arabs, armed with the new faith of Islam, conquered Syria, Mesopotamia, Persia
- 640: conquered Egypt
- 700: conquered Roman Africa
- 711: reached Spain and destroyed the West Goth's Germanic kingdom

### The Byzantine World, the Arabic World, and the West about AD 700

Eastern Roman/Byzantine Empire:
- capital: Constantinople
- included the Asia Minor peninsula, the Balkan peninsula, and parts of Italy
- Christian in religion and Greek in culture and language
- truest heirs to both Christianity and the Greeks
- most fluorishing and preeminent civilization

Arabic and Islamic:
- most extensive civilization of the three
- the Pyrenees through Spain and all of North Africa into Arabia, Syria, and the East
- language: Arabic
- religion: Islam
- caliph was the true religious and military successor to Muhammad
- early Muslims regarded themselves as successors to Judaism and Christianity, except Muhammad was the last and greatest of the prophets and that the Christian Trinity was blasphemous to the idea of a One True God
- quickly took over the civilization of lands they conquered, continuing ancient civilization
- Arabs went beyond the Greeks in the sciences, developing geography and algebra, inventing the "Arabic" numerals

Latin Christendom:
- included what the Byzantines were unable to hold and the Arabs were unable to conquer
- part of Italy, France, Belgium, the Rhineland, and Britain
- barbarian kings ruled small kingdoms, but all government had fallen into pieces
- Germanic, invading barbarians became the minority everywhere outside of Britain, but these Germanic influences are a decisive contributor to the making of Europe
	- some were Christian, mostly heathen
	- possessed an intricate folklore and religion, although no written language
	- agricultural people with knowledge of iron and Roman crafts
	- small tribes with strong kinship
	- more freedom than citizens of the Roman Empire
	- strong sense of loyalty to people, but little to institutions
Unable to maintain organization beyond the local level, Rome's architecture fell into ruins and the West fragmented, beginning the Dark Ages

### The Church and the Rise of the Papacy

The Church remained as the sole organized institution during this time
- monasteries grew in popularity and people rejected the savagery to retire to communities of their own, largely unmolested because their savage neighbors held them in religious awe
- monasteries directed by abbots
- Bishops, abbots, and monks looked with veneration to Rome as where St. Peter, the first apostle, had been martyred
- bishop of Rome took over the government and public affairs of Rome and was not dominated by any secular power, beginning the tradition of spiritual power independent from the political or temporal
- the authority of popes was built, and the church became synonymous to civilization and a higher way of life
	- forged "Donation of Constantine"
	- AD 340: Ulfilas went to convert the Goths
	- 496: the king of the Franks, Clovis, was converted to Christianity
	- 597: the king of Kent in southeast England yielded to Augustine of Canterbury and the Anglo-Saxons were christianized
	- AD 700: the borders of Christianity in the West became what they had been in the late Roman times

### The Empire of Charlemagne, AD 800

Charlemagne had risen as the greatest of a line of great Frankish kings
- in exchange for papal support, they protected the pope
- 800: the pope crowned Charlemagne the emperor of the West
- both Frankish kings and Roman bishops wished to restore the Roman Empire 
- Charlemagne crossed the Pyrenees, conquered northeast Spain, overthrew barbarian kings in Italy, conquered along the Danube and Bohemia and massacred and converted the Saxons along the river Elbe
- his empire became the Latin Christian world, outside of England and Ireland, uniting the west
- his capital became Aix-la-Chapelle, or Aachen, near the mouth of the Rhine
- the north became a center in its own right
	- intellectually: Latin and education, developing the Carolingian miniscule while recopying manuscripts
	- revived commerce, created a new and reliable coinage

### Ninth-Century Invasions; Europe by AD 1000

In Charlemagne's empire, Europe gains a culture and unit of society distinct from the Mediterranean world of antiquity
The barbarians that assailed Western Christendom became incorporated and converted by the year 1000:
- the Magyars ("Hungarians") who terrorized Europe until they settled on the middle Danube around 1900
- the Norsemen, Vikings, and Danes from Scandinavia
	- 874: discovered Iceland
	- 964: reached Kiev in Russia
	- 1000: touched the Americas
	- settled largely in the Danelaw in England and Normandy in France
- Arabs raided the shores of France and Italy, occupying Sicily 

The East and the West drifted apart, leading to the Great Schism of 1054, which divided the Christian world into the Latin/Roman Catholic and the Greek Orthodox churches
- Greek patriarchs at Constantinople refused to recognize the claims of the bishop of Rome
- the Roman pontiff refused to acknowledge the Byzantine Empire
- Russians sided with the Greek Orthodox
- Latin West cut another tie with antiquity, emerging as a more independent center of civilization

Modern Europe had taken shape by 1000:
- a kingdom of France adjoined to the bulk of Germany to the east
- small Christian kingdoms in northern Spain and city-states in the Italian peninsula
- kingdom of England and Scotland
- Denmark, Norway, and Sweden had taken form
- three kingdoms of Poland (Slavic), Bohemia (Slavic), Hungary (Magyar), all Latin and Catholic in culture and religion and Western in orientation
- the east Slavs, Russians, diverged from the West, christianized by Byzantine missionaries

## 3. The High Middle Ages: Secular Civilization
[Top](#unit-1-early-modern-and-medieval-europe)

### Changes after AD 1000

All the major cities of Europe before the modern industrial era sprang up between 1050-1200
The population of western Europe steadily grew from 1000-1300, which, along with agricultural changes, brought about the High Middle Ages, a period of rapid progress in secular matters
- after Norse and Magyar invasions ceased, Europe became more secure, so there was more planting and building
- a heavier plow, better harnesses, and windmills were invented
	- a characteristic of European civilization: a faculty for invention, a quest for new sources of energy
- people worked harder and obtained more results in kind
- slavery gradually disappeared, serfdom replacing it, since white slaves were usually war prisoners from unchristianized tribes

People became less isolated
- communications improved
- bridges rwere built across rivers
- settlers filled the wilderness that separated inhabited areas
- land cleared, people clustered in village communities
- "three-field" system: two parts were sowed, one was left fallow, rotating, to avoid soil exhaustion
	- increase in supply of food

Feudalism - increased peace and personal security necessary for agriculture
- "counts" governed territories of a few hundred square miles, maintaining control over lesser lords who possessed a few hundred/thousand acres, becoming the "lord"'s vassals
- the lord provided protection and justice and guaranteed that the rightful heirs of the vassals would inherit in due time
- vassal agreed to serve lord in the army for a certain number of days in the year, to attend and advise him in his court in the judging of disputes, and paying fees when inheriting an estate or when heirs were in wardship
- later, lords at the level of counts became vassalsof dukes
- 987: the great lords of France chose Hugh Capet as their king, becoming his vassals
	- French kings enjoyed little real power, but his descendants reigned until the French Revolution in the 18th century
- 911: magnates of Germany elected a king
	- 962: German king crowned emperor, creating the HRE
- 1066: William, the Duke of Normandy, conquered England and imposed a centralized and efficient type of feudalism developed in Normandy (unelected)
	- more civil peace and authority than the continent
- characterized by its mutual/reciprocal character, rather than an all-powerful sovereign, which also where ideas of constitutional government later developed
- applied only to the military or noble class
- peasantry: villages, with its people and surrounding farmlands, constituted a "manor" of a lord, who were serfs and "bound to the soil"
	- the lord owed them protection and justice, the serfs worked his land and gave him part of the produce

Increased agricultural efficiency led to a surplus of food, then to population, then to the development of towns

### The Rise of Towns and Commerce

In the 9th and 10th centuries, most of the ancient cities had vanished
- no commercial centers or merchant class
- Eastern or Jewish traders occasionally came, bringing Eastern silks, spices, and Judaism, as well as channels of distant communication

Long-distance trade developed first, followed by bustling local trade:
- Venice was founded in AD 570 when barbarian refugees settled in its islands
	- brought Eastern goods up the Adriatic to sell to central European traders
- Flanders, Belgium, manufacturers of woolen cloth developed
- these goods couldn't be produced locally yet were widely in demand, so merchants traveled
- money came back into more general circulation, merchants established permanent headquarters, craftsmen moved to these growing centers

By 1100, local centers existed from all over Europe, about every 20-30 miles, ranging from a few hundred to thousands of inhabitants
- merchants and craftsmen didn't want to remain subject to neighboring feudal lords since they couldn't protect them and could only extort them
- they developed their own laws of their own and tried to set themselves up as self-governing little republics
- emancipation most successful where towns were the largest and closest together along trade routes (north Italy, Danube and Rhine rivers, Flanders, Baltic coast)
	- Venice, Genoia, Pisa, Florence, Milan became virtually independent city-states
	- Bruges and Ghent in Flanders
	- Nuremberg, Frankfurt, Augsburg, Strasbourg, Hamburg, and Lubeck became free cities, only owing allegiance to an ineffective distant emperor
	- in France and England, less independence but received charters of liberties from the king, right to have their own governments, officials, courts, and laws, and to pay their own taxes to the king
- towns formed leagues/federations
	- Hanse: formed of German towns and dominated the commerce of the North Sea and the Baltic until the 1300s
	- kings in England, France, and Spain repressed these
	- becaues Italy, Germany, and the Netherlands were more commercially advanced than the Atlantic countries, they had a more intensive town life and resisted political unification, only creating nationwide states in 1860/1870

Independence in towns:
- Townsmen didn't possess individual rights, only those from being a resident
	- personal liberty (freedom from serfdom)
	- no one wanted individual liberty, instead wanting common solidarity, evidenced by the walls that protected the towns and gradually were built further out
- economic solidarity
	- neighboring peasants could only sell in the town marketplace to protect their food supply from competitions
	- forbade certain trades to be carried out in the country to force peasants to make purchases in town and protect town craftsmen
	- tariffs and tolls on the goods of other towns/merchants
	- coined their own money, particularly in Italy and Germany
- merchants and craftsmen formed "guilds"
	- guaranteed that work would be done by reliable and experience craftsmen and provided a means of vocational education for young men (boys would become apprentices, then become journeymen, who were qualified and recognized workers, and, if lucky, become masters themselves)
	- by the 1300s, guilds became frozen and masters became reluctant to admit others
	- masters preserved their reputation, divided work, fixed the terms of apprenticeship, wages paid to journeymen, and the prices of goods, and tried to regulate competition from nearby towns (people hated competition or the idea of working for monetary profit)

Towns widely influenced the country & freedom in it:
- emancipating influence
- increased the demand for food, so lords cleaered new lands (development of an internal frontier)
- lords offered freer terms for peasants who settled on new lands, serfdom became harder to justify when nearby villages were free
- peasants began earning money and lords wanted money to purchase goods in towns
- peasants obtained personal freedom in exchange for an annual monetary payment to the lord for an indefinite period
- serfdom began to disappear by the 12th century, and by the 15th it had disappeared from most of western Europe

### The Growth of National Monarchies

Kings tried to build their kingdoms to outlast them
- monarchy became hereditary because elections were typically turbulent and disputed
- kings sent out executive officers to supervise (sheriffs, bailiffs) and instituted royal courts under royal justices to decide property disputes and repress crime (main pillar of royal power, along with military might to enforce these judgments)
- England: development of the jury by requiring local inhabitatns to assist royal judges, putting them on oath
- kings needed money but taxation as in Rome was unknown to the Germanic and feudal tradition
	- some towns agreed to make certain payments in return for their royal charters
	- royal demands for money constantly grew and were met with resistance in all countries
	- Magna Carta in England in 1215: a group of English lords and high churchmen and representatives of London required King John to confirm and guarantee their historic liberties
- kings held a royal council/court with their vassals, from which departments of governments were birthed
	- royal judiciary, exchequer, military command, parliaments (as representatives of towns began to be summoned to the king's "talks" with his chief retainers)
	- rise of the "burghers", who had inferior dignity to lords and bishops but were too stubborn, free-spirited, and rich to be overlooked
- parliaments meant initially to publicize and strengthen royal rule but usually invited the parliament to state grievances, beginning the tradition of parliamentary legislation
	- parliaments represented the "estates of the realm"
		- first and highest: clergy
		- second: landed/noble class
		- third: burghers of the chartered towns
	- England, Poland, and Hungary: the clergy ceased to be represented, the bishops sitting with the lay magnates in an upper house
	- Poland, Bohemia, and Hungary: the burghers dropped out
	- Castile and Wurttemberg: the noble estate eventually refused to attend parliament
	- Scandinavia, Switzerland, and in the French Estates General: peasants were allowed to have delegates
	- England: the Parliament split into two houses, the Lords (great prelates and lay magnates) and the Commons (lesser landholders aka small nobles, representatives of towns)
		- becaues the Commons was made up of "knights and burgesses", or gentry and townsmen, added to its strength because the middle class was too weak to act alone
		- this helped root representative institutions in England when they died out later in other nations
		- additionally, since England was so small, with the north mostly wilderness, there were no provincial/local parliamentary bodies to dispute the power of the central body
		- elected members of the House of Commons obtained early on the power to commit their constituents (those who elected them had to pay the taxes they voted), wit hvotes being binding, so Parliament excercised powers as well as rights
	- the idea of representative government, that had never truly appeared before
