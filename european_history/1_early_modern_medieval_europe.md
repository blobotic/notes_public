## 2. The Early Middle Ages: The Formation of Europe
[Top](#unit-1-early-modern-and-medieval-europe)

Ancient times:
- Africa was Tunisia-Algeria
- Asia was Asia Minor
- Europe wasn't referenced
Between the 5th-10th centuries, Europe emerged, defining its people as something distinct from Asia and Africa

### The Disintegration of the Roman Empire

The Roman Empire fragmented after Constantine embraced Christianity in hopes of strengthening the imperial system and founded an eastern capital in Byzantium, shifting the center of gravity eastward. 

Romans drew a line beyond which they rarely ventured and wouldn't allow the barbarians to pass, but they still filtered in
- recruited to serve in the Roman armies, after which they would receive farmlands
By the 4th/5th centuries, individuals of barbarian birth began reaching high positions of state
Simultaneously, the activity of Roman cities faltered, commerce decayed, taxes became ruinous, the army seated and unseated emperors
The West and thus Rome became indistinguishable with the barbarian world

Barbarians began to seek access to Rome, tribes of tens of thousands plundering and conquering as they went
- 380: West Goths in Constantinople
- 382: East Goths appeared in Asia Minor in 382 
- 396: West Goths tore through Greece
- 410: West Goths sacked Rome
- 429: Vandals reached Roman Africa
- 420: West Goths reached Spain
- 450: Angles and Saxons overran Britain, Franks invaded Gaul
- 450: The Huns cut through central Europe and France under Attila, the "scourge of God"
- 476: The last Roman emperor in the West was deposed by a barbarian chieftain
- 493: East Goths in Italy

- 632: after Muhammad's death, the Arabs, armed with the new faith of Islam, conquered Syria, Mesopotamia, Persia
- 640: conquered Egypt
- 700: conquered Roman Africa
- 711: reached Spain and destroyed the West Goth's Germanic kingdom

### The Byzantine World, the Arabic World, and the West about AD 700

Eastern Roman/Byzantine Empire:
- capital: Constantinople
- included the Asia Minor peninsula, the Balkan peninsula, and parts of Italy
- Christian in religion and Greek in culture and language
- truest heirs to both Christianity and the Greeks
- most fluorishing and preeminent civilization

Arabic and Islamic:
- most extensive civilization of the three
- the Pyrenees through Spain and all of North Africa into Arabia, Syria, and the East
- language: Arabic
- religion: Islam
- caliph was the true religious and military successor to Muhammad
- early Muslims regarded themselves as successors to Judaism and Christianity, except Muhammad was the last and greatest of the prophets and that the Christian Trinity was blasphemous to the idea of a One True God
- quickly took over the civilization of lands they conquered, continuing ancient civilization
- Arabs went beyond the Greeks in the sciences, developing geography and algebra, inventing the "Arabic" numerals

Latin Christendom:
- included what the Byzantines were unable to hold and the Arabs were unable to conquer
- part of Italy, France, Belgium, the Rhineland, and Britain
- barbarian kings ruled small kingdoms, but all government had fallen into pieces
- Germanic, invading barbarians became the minority everywhere outside of Britain, but these Germanic influences are a decisive contributor to the making of Europe
	- some were Christian, mostly heathen
	- possessed an intricate folklore and religion, although no written language
	- agricultural people with knowledge of iron and Roman crafts
	- small tribes with strong kinship
	- more freedom than citizens of the Roman Empire
	- strong sense of loyalty to people, but little to institutions
Unable to maintain organization beyond the local level, Rome's architecture fell into ruins and the West fragmented, beginning the Dark Ages

### The Church and the Rise of the Papacy

The Church remained as the sole organized institution during this time
- monasteries grew in popularity and people rejected the savagery to retire to communities of their own, largely unmolested because their savage neighbors held them in religious awe
- monasteries directed by abbots
- Bishops, abbots, and monks looked with veneration to Rome as where St. Peter, the first apostle, had been martyred
- bishop of Rome took over the government and public affairs of Rome and was not dominated by any secular power, beginning the tradition of spiritual power independent from the political or temporal
- the authority of popes was built, and the church became synonymous to civilization and a higher way of life
	- forged "Donation of Constantine"
	- AD 340: Ulfilas went to convert the Goths
	- 496: the king of the Franks, Clovis, was converted to Christianity
	- 597: the king of Kent in southeast England yielded to Augustine of Canterbury and the Anglo-Saxons were christianized
	- AD 700: the borders of Christianity in the West became what they had been in the late Roman times

### The Empire of Charlemagne, AD 800

Charlemagne had risen as the greatest of a line of great Frankish kings
- in exchange for papal support, they protected the pope
- 800: the pope crowned Charlemagne the emperor of the West
- both Frankish kings and Roman bishops wished to restore the Roman Empire 
- Charlemagne crossed the Pyrenees, conquered northeast Spain, overthrew barbarian kings in Italy, conquered along the Danube and Bohemia and massacred and converted the Saxons along the river Elbe
- his empire became the Latin Christian world, outside of England and Ireland, uniting the west
- his capital became Aix-la-Chapelle, or Aachen, near the mouth of the Rhine
- the north became a center in its own right
	- intellectually: Latin and education, developing the Carolingian miniscule while recopying manuscripts
	- revived commerce, created a new and reliable coinage

### Ninth-Century Invasions; Europe by AD 1000

In Charlemagne's empire, Europe gains a culture and unit of society distinct from the Mediterranean world of antiquity
The barbarians that assailed Western Christendom became incorporated and converted by the year 1000:
- the Magyars ("Hungarians") who terrorized Europe until they settled on the middle Danube around 1900
- the Norsemen, Vikings, and Danes from Scandinavia
	- 874: discovered Iceland
	- 964: reached Kiev in Russia
	- 1000: touched the Americas
	- settled largely in the Danelaw in England and Normandy in France
- Arabs raided the shores of France and Italy, occupying Sicily 

The East and the West drifted apart, leading to the Great Schism of 1054, which divided the Christian world into the Latin/Roman Catholic and the Greek Orthodox churches
- Greek patriarchs at Constantinople refused to recognize the claims of the bishop of Rome
- the Roman pontiff refused to acknowledge the Byzantine Empire
- Russians sided with the Greek Orthodox
- Latin West cut another tie with antiquity, emerging as a more independent center of civilization

Modern Europe had taken shape by 1000:
- a kingdom of France adjoined to the bulk of Germany to the east
- small Christian kingdoms in northern Spain and city-states in the Italian peninsula
- kingdom of England and Scotland
- Denmark, Norway, and Sweden had taken form
- three kingdoms of Poland (Slavic), Bohemia (Slavic), Hungary (Magyar), all Latin and Catholic in culture and religion and Western in orientation
- the east Slavs, Russians, diverged from the West, christianized by Byzantine missionaries

## 3. The High Middle Ages: Secular Civilization
[Top](#unit-1-early-modern-and-medieval-europe)

### Changes after AD 1000

All the major cities of Europe before the modern industrial era sprang up between 1050-1200
The population of western Europe steadily grew from 1000-1300, which, along with agricultural changes, brought about the High Middle Ages, a period of rapid progress in secular matters
- after Norse and Magyar invasions ceased, Europe became more secure, so there was more planting and building
- a heavier plow, better harnesses, and windmills were invented
	- a characteristic of European civilization: a faculty for invention, a quest for new sources of energy
- people worked harder and obtained more results in kind
- slavery gradually disappeared, serfdom replacing it, since white slaves were usually war prisoners from unchristianized tribes

People became less isolated
- communications improved
- bridges rwere built across rivers
- settlers filled the wilderness that separated inhabited areas
- land cleared, people clustered in village communities
- "three-field" system: two parts were sowed, one was left fallow, rotating, to avoid soil exhaustion
	- increase in supply of food

Feudalism - increased peace and personal security necessary for agriculture
- "counts" governed territories of a few hundred square miles, maintaining control over lesser lords who possessed a few hundred/thousand acres, becoming the "lord"'s vassals
- the lord provided protection and justice and guaranteed that the rightful heirs of the vassals would inherit in due time
- vassal agreed to serve lord in the army for a certain number of days in the year, to attend and advise him in his court in the judging of disputes, and paying fees when inheriting an estate or when heirs were in wardship
- later, lords at the level of counts became vassalsof dukes
- 987: the great lords of France chose Hugh Capet as their king, becoming his vassals
	- French kings enjoyed little real power, but his descendants reigned until the French Revolution in the 18th century
- 911: magnates of Germany elected a king
	- 962: German king crowned emperor, creating the HRE
- 1066: William, the Duke of Normandy, conquered England and imposed a centralized and efficient type of feudalism developed in Normandy (unelected)
	- more civil peace and authority than the continent
- characterized by its mutual/reciprocal character, rather than an all-powerful sovereign, which also where ideas of constitutional government later developed
- applied only to the military or noble class
- peasantry: villages, with its people and surrounding farmlands, constituted a "manor" of a lord, who were serfs and "bound to the soil"
	- the lord owed them protection and justice, the serfs worked his land and gave him part of the produce

Increased agricultural efficiency led to a surplus of food, then to population, then to the development of towns

### The Rise of Towns and Commerce

In the 9th and 10th centuries, most of the ancient cities had vanished
- no commercial centers or merchant class
- Eastern or Jewish traders occasionally came, bringing Eastern silks, spices, and Judaism, as well as channels of distant communication

Long-distance trade developed first, followed by bustling local trade:
- Venice was founded in AD 570 when barbarian refugees settled in its islands
	- brought Eastern goods up the Adriatic to sell to central European traders
- Flanders, Belgium, manufacturers of woolen cloth developed
- these goods couldn't be produced locally yet were widely in demand, so merchants traveled
- money came back into more general circulation, merchants established permanent headquarters, craftsmen moved to these growing centers

By 1100, local centers existed from all over Europe, about every 20-30 miles, ranging from a few hundred to thousands of inhabitants
- merchants and craftsmen didn't want to remain subject to neighboring feudal lords since they couldn't protect them and could only extort them
- they developed their own laws of their own and tried to set themselves up as self-governing little republics
- emancipation most successful where towns were the largest and closest together along trade routes (north Italy, Danube and Rhine rivers, Flanders, Baltic coast)
	- Venice, Genoia, Pisa, Florence, Milan became virtually independent city-states
	- Bruges and Ghent in Flanders
	- Nuremberg, Frankfurt, Augsburg, Strasbourg, Hamburg, and Lubeck became free cities, only owing allegiance to an ineffective distant emperor
	- in France and England, less independence but received charters of liberties from the king, right to have their own governments, officials, courts, and laws, and to pay their own taxes to the king
- towns formed leagues/federations
	- Hanse: formed of German towns and dominated the commerce of the North Sea and the Baltic until the 1300s
	- kings in England, France, and Spain repressed these
	- becaues Italy, Germany, and the Netherlands were more commercially advanced than the Atlantic countries, they had a more intensive town life and resisted political unification, only creating nationwide states in 1860/1870

Independence in towns:
- Townsmen didn't possess individual rights, only those from being a resident
	- personal liberty (freedom from serfdom)
	- no one wanted individual liberty, instead wanting common solidarity, evidenced by the walls that protected the towns and gradually were built further out
- economic solidarity
	- neighboring peasants could only sell in the town marketplace to protect their food supply from competitions
	- forbade certain trades to be carried out in the country to force peasants to make purchases in town and protect town craftsmen
	- tariffs and tolls on the goods of other towns/merchants
	- coined their own money, particularly in Italy and Germany
- merchants and craftsmen formed "guilds"
	- guaranteed that work would be done by reliable and experience craftsmen and provided a means of vocational education for young men (boys would become apprentices, then become journeymen, who were qualified and recognized workers, and, if lucky, become masters themselves)
	- by the 1300s, guilds became frozen and masters became reluctant to admit others
	- masters preserved their reputation, divided work, fixed the terms of apprenticeship, wages paid to journeymen, and the prices of goods, and tried to regulate competition from nearby towns (people hated competition or the idea of working for monetary profit)

Towns widely influenced the country & freedom in it:
- emancipating influence
- increased the demand for food, so lords cleaered new lands (development of an internal frontier)
- lords offered freer terms for peasants who settled on new lands, serfdom became harder to justify when nearby villages were free
- peasants began earning money and lords wanted money to purchase goods in towns
- peasants obtained personal freedom in exchange for an annual monetary payment to the lord for an indefinite period
- serfdom began to disappear by the 12th century, and by the 15th it had disappeared from most of western Europe

### The Growth of National Monarchies

Kings tried to build their kingdoms to outlast them
- monarchy became hereditary because elections were typically turbulent and disputed
- kings sent out executive officers to supervise (sheriffs, bailiffs) and instituted royal courts under royal justices to decide property disputes and repress crime (main pillar of royal power, along with military might to enforce these judgments)
- England: development of the jury by requiring local inhabitatns to assist royal judges, putting them on oath
- kings needed money but taxation as in Rome was unknown to the Germanic and feudal tradition
	- some towns agreed to make certain payments in return for their royal charters
	- royal demands for money constantly grew and were met with resistance in all countries
	- Magna Carta in England in 1215: a group of English lords and high churchmen and representatives of London required King John to confirm and guarantee their historic liberties
- kings held a royal council/court with their vassals, from which departments of governments were birthed
	- royal judiciary, exchequer, military command, parliaments (as representatives of towns began to be summoned to the king's "talks" with his chief retainers)
	- rise of the "burghers", who had inferior dignity to lords and bishops but were too stubborn, free-spirited, and rich to be overlooked
- parliaments meant initially to publicize and strengthen royal rule but usually invited the parliament to state grievances, beginning the tradition of parliamentary legislation
	- parliaments represented the "estates of the realm"
		- first and highest: clergy
		- second: landed/noble class
		- third: burghers of the chartered towns
	- England, Poland, and Hungary: the clergy ceased to be represented, the bishops sitting with the lay magnates in an upper house
	- Poland, Bohemia, and Hungary: the burghers dropped out
	- Castile and Wurttemberg: the noble estate eventually refused to attend parliament
	- Scandinavia, Switzerland, and in the French Estates General: peasants were allowed to have delegates
	- England: the Parliament split into two houses, the Lords (great prelates and lay magnates) and the Commons (lesser landholders aka small nobles, representatives of towns)
		- becaues the Commons was made up of "knights and burgesses", or gentry and townsmen, added to its strength because the middle class was too weak to act alone
		- this helped root representative institutions in England when they died out later in other nations
		- additionally, since England was so small, with the north mostly wilderness, there were no provincial/local parliamentary bodies to dispute the power of the central body
		- elected members of the House of Commons obtained early on the power to commit their constituents (those who elected them had to pay the taxes they voted), wit hvotes being binding, so Parliament excercised powers as well as rights
	- the idea of representative government, that had never truly appeared before


## 4. The High Middle Ages: The Church
[Top](#unit-1-early-modern-and-medieval-europe)

The church was omnipresent
- the mutual duties of lord and vassal were confirmed by religious oaths, bishops and abbots embedded themselves into the feudal system
- the king was crowned by the church and anointed with holy oils
- guilds were lay religious brotherhoods, choosing a patron saint
- townspeople watched religious dramas
- towns enacted the Gothic cathedrals that still stand today

### The Development of the Medieval Church and Papacy

During the 10th century, the church was in decay
- fragmented and localized, illiterate clergy, faith mixed with pagan superstition, monasteries in decay, priests breaking celibacy, lay investiture
- there was the notion of a grandness of Rome, but the actual bishop of Rome was mistreated and was largely taken over by Roman nobles

Reform during the 11th century
- sometimes a secular ruler wanted to correct conditions in his domains, so he asserted a strict control over his clergy
	- in 962 the HRE proclaimed itself the continuation of the Roman and Carolingian empires, an extension of the Christian faith
- some Christians wanted reform
	- monastery of Cluny in France to purify monastic life and set a higher Christian ideal
	- refused to recognize any authority except for Rome
	- 1059: Pope Nicholas II issued a decree providing that future popes should be elected by the cardinals

Gregory VII, Hildebrand, one of the first such popes
- influenced by Cluniac reformers
- wished for a society in which religious interests stood far above secular interests; where political barriers have dropped in favor of the church; the Pope stands at the head
- believed in separation of church from worldly society, a pope could punish kings and emperors 
- a world adminsitered by a single, united clergy
- required celibacy of the clergy, which had never been generally established by the Greek Orthodox church or the Protestants in the West
- rejected lay iinvestiture, coming into conflict with the Holy Roman Emperor, Henry IV
	- in the HRE, bishops held much land
	- Gregory supported the rebellion of German bishops and nobles then excommunicated him
	- in penance, Henry sought the pope in Canossa in Italy (submission to Rome)
- 1122: bishops recognized the emperor as their feudal head but looked to Rome for spiritual authority
- struggle between popes a
nd emperors continued (Italy, Germany)
	- centralization of Latin Christendom under Rome
	- blocked national unity in central Europe

Innocent III (1198-1216)
- virtually realized Gregory's dream of a united Christian world, recognized as a supreme arbiter
	- a king of France took a wife, a king of England accepted an unwanted archbishop, a king of Leon divorced the cousin he had married, a claimant to the crown of Hungary deferred to his rival
	- advised kings of Bohemia, Poland, and Denmark
	- kings of England, Aragon, and Portugal acknowledged him as feudal overlord
	- vast funds flowed into Rome and an enormous bureaucracy flourished
- 1215: great church council of 500 bishops and patriarchs of Constantinople and Jersualem (Fourth Lateran Council)
	- purpose: keep the clergy from worldly temptations
	- forbid priests to officiate at ordeals or trials by battle, ending them as a practice
	- regulate belief in the supernatural
	- declared sacraments to be the channel of God's saving grace

### Intellectual Life: The Universities, Scholasticism

12th and 13th centuries: founding of the first universities
- by 1200: center of medical studies at Salerno in south Italy, legal studies in Bologna in north Italy, theological studies at Paris
- Oxford founded around 1200 by a secession of disgruntled students and professors from Paris, Cambridge soon after
- 1300: almost a dozen universities in Latin Europe
- 1500: almost a hundred

Universities originated from gatherings of students and teachers developing into organized institutions that characterized various crafts in the High Middle Ages
- universities united a body of men under an interest in learning and a communal name and being, possessng liberties under a charter and self-regulated
- received income from pious donors and from holding land
- collection of distinct schools or "faculties" P(i.e. theology, law, and medicine)
- gave examinations and awarded degrees (initially for teaching) that were recognized throughout the Latin West, so students and teachers could freely move from one university to another
- this all allowed the university to survive as an institution beyond a single lifetime

Theology, the beginning of questioning religion
- 11th century: Anselm, Italian, archbishop of Canterbury, wrote *Cur Deus Homo?* - "Why did God become man?" to explain why God took human form to save mankind
- Abelard of Paris wrote *Sic et Non* - "Yes and No"/"Pro and Con", a collection of inconsistent statements made by St. Augustine and other Fathers of the Church, to show the true consistency in the faith of Christian doctrine

Science and philosophy, the start of an intellectual revolution
- derived from the Arabs (Sicily and Spain), who had taken over the ancient Greek science, translating their works, some of which had been translated from Greek to Arabic, to Latin
- translated Aristotle, the codifier of Greek knowledge from the 4th century
- struggled to conciliate Greek and Arabic learning with the Christian faith
	- Thomas Aquinas (1225-1274), an Angelic Doctor, *Summa Theologica*, a survey of all knowledge
		- 1879: Pope Leo XIII pronounced his work to be the foundation of Catholic philosophy
		- demonstrated that faith and reason weren't in conflict
		- "realism" philosophy - the general idea is more "real" than a particular, the superiority of abstraction, letting people maintain their faith in the church despite the corruption of individual members
		- taught a hierarchical view of the universe and society, everything subordinated to God
- scholastic philosophy made it difficult for natural science to fluorish but laid the foundation to exactness and disciplined thinking, as well as making the world safe for reason (in contrast to the Muslim world)

### The Crusades; New Invasions; Europe by 1300

the best remembered and least successful Crusades were those for the Holy Land
- First Crusade
	- 1095: Pope Urban II hoped to advance the peace of God by leading bellicose nobles to fight the infidels and to build up the leadership of Rome
- following Crusades to the Holy Land went on for 200 years
- growth of Italian shipping in the Mediterranean, rise of more orderly feudal monarchies, increasing sense of a Europe-wide common purpose enabled this
- consequence of Europe's growing strength
- 12th century: Latin Christians occupied Palestine and Syria, but had to withdraw by the 13th century

Crusades within Europe found more success and more lasting results
- Normans won Sicily from the Arabs in 1100
- 1250: Iberian Christians from the mountains of northern Spain carred on a reconquista for 2 centuries against the Moors, founding Portugal, Leon, Castile, Aragon, and Valencia, and later capturing Granada from the Muslims in the south in 1492
- 13th century: Albigensian crusade in southern France
- Teutonic Order (a military-religious society of knights founded to fight in the Holy Land) carried out crusades in the north against the remaining European heathen (Prussia and east Baltic regions)

1250: threat of invasion from Asia
- Tartars in the 13th century
- Ottoman Turks in the 14th century
- but by the 13th century, Europe was finally capable of resistance, having assimilated all of Europe, uniting them under the Roman church, Latin, feudalism, monarchy, free town life, parliamentary assemblies, and scholastic learning

the "rise of Europe", although Europe remained only one unremarkable power amongst the other great cultures of the world
- China had a more fluorishing culture, cities, merchant class, manufacturers, iron, arts and sciences, centralized and complex government, learning, language, etc 
- but it was the disorder of Europe that created a dynamism and freedom that promoted change and an enterprising/restless spirit

## 5. Disasters of the Fourteenth Century
[Top](#unit-1-early-modern-and-medieval-europe)

"secularization" - modernize and adapt a religion to make room for nonreligious interests
- Chinese and Confucius
- Muslims and Koran
- India and Hindu
- world civilization comes from traditional cultures becoming increasingly secularized

Decline of Christianity in the 13th century
- 1240: Mongols held Russia for 200 years
- Ottoman Turks invaded the Byzantine Empire and crushed the Serbian kingdom in the battle of Kosovo in 1389, taking over the Balkans and Constantinople in 1453
- authority of the papacy and the Roman Catholic Church questioned, leading to the rise of the Protestant church
- divergence from Christian ideals, pursuit of government, law, philosophy, science, arts, economic activities

### The Black Death and Its Consequences

Black Death, the bubonic plague
- 1348: first appeared
- 14th century: half the population wiped out
- bacillus carried by rats, making crowded towns vulnerable
- villages died out, fields abandonedl, trade obstructed, prices, wages, and incomes erratic, famines and other disease
- labor became scarce so wages were higher, although work was harder to find because of disorganization and the decimation of urban employers
- English Statute of Laborers of 1351: upper classes tried to contol wages and prices through the government
- worker rebellions broke out
	- Flanders
	- peasant insurrections
	- "jacqueries" - France, first in 1358
	- 1381: Wat Tyler's rebellion in England
- governments suppressed these and the peasants returned to normal but with better conditions because landowners had to appease them to get work done on their manors
	- lifetime (hereditary) tenures, decreased value of shilling decreased burden of debt
	- class of small peasant property owners emerged
- kings needed more spending power to maintain their governments and to employ soldiers to suppress feudal resistance
	- currency debased, giving the king more money but decreasing the value of money (inflation)
	- new taxes 
		- 1300: kings of England and France tax clergy
		- increasing demands of merchants and landholders
		- resistance from them and subject to bargains by representative bodies ("golden age" of parliaments)

1337: Hundred Years'War between England and France
- took palce in internally divided France
- France severely divided until the days of Joan of Arc, burned at Rouen in 1431
- in contrast, patriotism rose in England and Parliament grew stronger as kings needed money
- disorder became worse
	- great barons more unruly
	- deposed Richard II in 1399
	- Scotland invasion, Wales revolt
	- dukes and earls fought with private armies, disobeyed royal law courts, exploited Parliament, government, and their peasants
- 1450: Jack Cade's rebellion called for reform without success
- 1450-1485: Wars of the Roses
	- upper-class turmoil

### Troubles of the Medieval Church

corruption of the papacy
- 1300: zenith of the church of the High Middle Ages
- corruption: belief that the institution existed to benefit its officials
	- refusal to reform internally or externally
	- out of touch with public opinion
	- self-perpetuating bureaucracy 
- *Unam Sanctum* by pope Boniface VIII in response to Edward I of England and Philip the Fair of France trying to tax the church in the 1290s
	- no salvation outside of the Roman church
	- French sent soldiers to arrest Boniface, who soon died
	- "Babylonian Captivity" of the church: election of a pope subservient to Philip and who lived on the borders of France
- 1378: Great Schism of the West
	- College of Cardinals elected two popes, one who lived in Rome and the other Avignon, both of whom refused to resign
	- France recognized Avignon, England and Germany recognized the Roman
- unparalleled splendor of the papacy
	- papal courts surpassed the kings' courts, officialdom flourished, revenues increased, new papal taxes ("annates", every bishop/abbot had to transmit to Rome most of the first year's income of his office)
	- international bankers
- shaky foundation
	- after escaping subserviency to the French, the papal divide led to complaints about extravagance and worldliness of papal rule
	- religious insecurity because of the disgrace of popes and the absence of security in their church being "correct"
	-  people turned to heretics and witchcraft out of fear for the wrath of God, others turning to self-indulgence
	- dissatisfaction/disbelief with the church spread
	- *Piers Plowman* by William Langland in the 1360s: contrasted the sufferings of the honest poor with the hypocripsy and corruption of high places
	- Lollards: advocating for the poor against the corrupt elite
	- 1380: Wyclif believed that organized church might not be necessary for salvation
		- true church didn't need worldy lpossessions
		- John Huss in Bohemia echoed the sentiment
		- Hussites became a religious and a Slavic/Czech party, protesting against the supremacy of the Germans in Bohemia
		- Hussite wars
	- Lollards/Huss/Wyclif: branded as heresy

### The Conciliar Movement

1409: a church council met at Pisa with representatives from the entirety of the LAtin West
- deposed the two reigning popes and elected another
	- they refused to resign, so there were now three popes

1414: a greater council met at Constance
- to end the 3-fold schism
	- all three popes withdrew and Martin V. was elected, restoring the unity of the church
- to extirpate heresy
	- John Huss interrogated, condemned, and burnt at stake
- to reform the church from top to bottom

popes vs councils
- the majority wanted to make the council permanent and consider the pope as a constitutional monarch, but Martin V. immediately  dissolved the Council of Constance after taking office
- next 30 years was a clash between popes and councils
- the church became more corrupt
	- "simony", the buying or selling of church offices, which was a crime in canon law, was unenforceable 
	- 1300: Boniface VIII encouraged the practice of "indulgences"
- popes gradually prevailed over the councils
	- conciliar movement weakened when the French element secured its aims by a local national arrangement
	- 1438: in the Pragmatic Sanction of Bourges, the Gallican (French) church affirmed
		- councils > popes
		- independence from the Holy See and suppression of payment of annates to Rome
		- forbade papal intervention in the appointment of French prelates
		- papacy lost influence in France
- 1449: Council of Basel dissolved, and the conciliar movement ended
- 1450: Jubilee to celebrate the papal triumph

popes of the Renaissance
- accomplished scholars
	- Nicholas V (1447-1455)
	- Pius II (1458-1464) 
- popular
	- Innocent VIII (1484-1492), first pope to dine in public with ladies
- corruption
	- Alexander VI (1492-1503), Spanish Borgia family, tried to make his son Cesare Borgia the ruler of Italy while his daughter, Lucretia Borgia, gathered literary men and artists around her with an exaggerated reputation for depravity
- general
	- Julius II (1503-1513), Alexander VI's successor
- patron of arts and architecture
