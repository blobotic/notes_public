## 2. The Early Middle Ages: The Formation of Europe

Ancient times:
- Africa was Tunisia-Algeria
- Asia was Asia Minor
- Europe wasn't referenced
Between the 5th-10th centuries, Europe emerged, defining its people as something distinct from Asia and Africa

### The Disintegration of the Roman Empire

The Roman Empire fragmented after Constantine embraced Christianity in hopes of strengthening the imperial system and founded an eastern capital in Byzantium, shifting the center of gravity eastward. 

Romans drew a line beyond which they rarely ventured and wouldn't allow the barbarians to pass, but they still filtered in
- recruited to serve in the Roman armies, after which they would receive farmlands
By the 4th/5th centuries, individuals of barbarian birth began reaching high positions of state
Simultaneously, the activity of Roman cities faltered, commerce decayed, taxes became ruinous, the army seated and unseated emperors
The West and thus Rome became indistinguishable with the barbarian world

Barbarians began to seek access to Rome, tribes of tens of thousands plundering and conquering as they went
- 380: West Goths in Constantinople
- 382: East Goths appeared in Asia Minor in 382 
- 396: West Goths tore through Greece
- 410: West Goths sacked Rome
- 429: Vandals reached Roman Africa
- 420: West Goths reached Spain
- 450: Angles and Saxons overran Britain, Franks invaded Gaul
- 450: The Huns cut through central Europe and France under Attila, the "scourge of God"
- 476: The last Roman emperor in the West was deposed by a barbarian chieftain
- 493: East Goths in Italy

- 632: after Muhammad's death, the Arabs, armed with the new faith of Islam, conquered Syria, Mesopotamia, Persia
- 640: conquered Egypt
- 700: conquered Roman Africa
- 711: reached Spain and destroyed the West Goth's Germanic kingdom

### The Byzantine World, the Arabic World, and the West about AD 700

Eastern Roman/Byzantine Empire:
- capital: Constantinople
- included the Asia Minor peninsula, the Balkan peninsula, and parts of Italy
- Christian in religion and Greek in culture and language
- truest heirs to both Christianity and the Greeks
- most fluorishing and preeminent civilization

Arabic and Islamic:
- most extensive civilization of the three
- the Pyrenees through Spain and all of North Africa into Arabia, Syria, and the East
- language: Arabic
- religion: Islam
- caliph was the true religious and military successor to Muhammad
- early Muslims regarded themselves as successors to Judaism and Christianity, except Muhammad was the last and greatest of the prophets and that the Christian Trinity was blasphemous to the idea of a One True God
- quickly took over the civilization of lands they conquered, continuing ancient civilization
- Arabs went beyond the Greeks in the sciences, developing geography and algebra, inventing the "Arabic" numerals

Latin Christendom:
- included what the Byzantines were unable to hold and the Arabs were unable to conquer
- part of Italy, France, Belgium, the Rhineland, and Britain
- barbarian kings ruled small kingdoms, but all government had fallen into pieces
- Germanic, invading barbarians became the minority everywhere outside of Britain, but these Germanic influences are a decisive contributor to the making of Europe
	- some were Christian, mostly heathen
	- possessed an intricate folklore and religion, although no written language
	- agricultural people with knowledge of iron and Roman crafts
	- small tribes with strong kinship
	- more freedom than citizens of the Roman Empire
	- strong sense of loyalty to people, but little to institutions
Unable to maintain organization beyond the local level, Rome's architecture fell into ruins and the West fragmented, beginning the Dark Ages

### The Church and the Rise of the Papacy

The Church remained as the sole organized institution during this time
- monasteries grew in popularity and people rejected the savagery to retire to communities of their own, largely unmolested because their savage neighbors held them in religious awe
- monasteries directed by abbots
- Bishops, abbots, and monks looked with veneration to Rome as where St. Peter, the first apostle, had been martyred
- bishop of Rome took over the government and public affairs of Rome and was not dominated by any secular power, beginning the tradition of spiritual power independent from the political or temporal
- the authority of popes was built, and the church became synonymous to civilization and a higher way of life
	- forged "Donation of Constantine"
	- AD 340: Ulfilas went to convert the Goths
	- 496: the king of the Franks, Clovis, was converted to Christianity
	- 597: the king of Kent in southeast England yielded to Augustine of Canterbury and the Anglo-Saxons were christianized
	- AD 700: the borders of Christianity in the West became what they had been in the late Roman times

### The Empire of Charlemagne, AD 800

Charlemagne had risen as the greatest of a line of great Frankish kings
- in exchange for papal support, they protected the pope
- 800: the pope crowned Charlemagne the emperor of the West
- both Frankish kings and Roman bishops wished to restore the Roman Empire 
- Charlemagne crossed the Pyrenees, conquered northeast Spain, overthrew barbarian kings in Italy, conquered along the Danube and Bohemia and massacred and converted the Saxons along the river Elbe
- his empire became the Latin Christian world, outside of England and Ireland, uniting the west
- his capital became Aix-la-Chapelle, or Aachen, near the mouth of the Rhine
- the north became a center in its own right
	- intellectually: Latin and education, developing the Carolingian miniscule while recopying manuscripts
	- revived commerce, created a new and reliable coinage

### Ninth-Century Invasions; Europe by AD 1000

In Charlemagne's empire, Europe gains a culture and unit of society distinct from the Mediterranean world of antiquity
The barbarians that assailed Western Christendom became incorporated and converted by the year 1000:
- the Magyars ("Hungarians") who terrorized Europe until they settled on the middle Danube around 1900
- the Norsemen, Vikings, and Danes from Scandinavia
	- 874: discovered Iceland
	- 964: reached Kiev in Russia
	- 1000: touched the Americas
	- settled largely in the Danelaw in England and Normandy in France
- Arabs raided the shores of France and Italy, occupying Sicily 

The East and the West drifted apart, leading to the Great Schism of 1054, which divided the Christian world into the Latin/Roman Catholic and the Greek Orthodox churches
- Greek patriarchs at Constantinople refused to recognize the claims of the bishop of Rome
- the Roman pontiff refused to acknowledge the Byzantine Empire
- Russians sided with the Greek Orthodox
- Latin West cut another tie with antiquity, emerging as a more independent center of civilization

Modern Europe had taken shape by 1000:
- a kingdom of France adjoined to the bulk of Germany to the east
- small Christian kingdoms in northern Spain and city-states in the Italian peninsula
- kingdom of England and Scotland
- Denmark, Norway, and Sweden had taken form
- three kingdoms of Poland (Slavic), Bohemia (Slavic), Hungary (Magyar), all Latin and Catholic in culture and religion and Western in orientation
- the east Slavs, Russians, diverged from the West, christianized by Byzantine missionaries
