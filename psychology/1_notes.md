# Unit 1: History and Approaches (In-class notes)

There used to be supernatural explanations for non neurotypical behaviors, with "treatment" being death, various forms of torture, exile, exorcism, and, more recently, lobotomy. Religion was often the explanation.

Trepanning: cracking a hole in the skull to release spirits

Philosophy:
- nature, knowledge & skill are innate
	- **Plato**
	- **Descartes**
		- experiments on small mammals and amphibians, frogs in particular
		- discovered that nerves control muscle movement
		- believed animal spirits flowed through nerves to cause muscle movement, erroneously
- nurture, we're shaped by our experiences and our environment
	- **Aristotle**
		- Plato's student
	- *tabula rasa* - blank slate
	- **John Locke**

Structuralism: to identify different elements/structures of the mind
- one of the first schools of thought
- **Wundt**: founds the first psychology lab in Germany in 1879
	- measured reaction time
	- difference between experiencing and perceiving sensations
- **Titchener**: moves to the US and founds a psychology lab at Cornell
	- student of Wundt
	- "periodic table" of sensations of the mind using introspection
	- claimed to map over 40,000 sensations

---

Functionalism: our behavior is adapted for by natural selection
- **Charles Darwin**: theory of natural selection
- **William James**: founded a psychology lab at Harvard
	- writes the first psych textbook, *Principles of Psychology*
- **Mary Whiton Caulkins**: woman in psychology
	- William James' student
	- other students at Harvard walked out, so she was tutored 1-on-1

Psychoanalysis:
- **Freud**: many of his ideas and theories are embedded in aspects of therapy today
	- id-ego-superego
		- guilt is a weapon of the superego
	- stages of development
		- **oral: 0-1**: id, unfiltered wants and desires
		- **anal: 1-3**: ego, resides in reality and keeps the id in check, control
		- **oedipal: 3-5/6**: superego, a sense of morality/norms of society arising from a conflict
			- boys demand mother's attention, girls notice something different from father
			- superego not ingrained as deeply in girls because of the less significant conflict

Behaviorism: interested in observable responses only
- **Ivan Pavlov**: classical conditioning
	- 1880s: research on digestive enzymes of saliva
	- discovers that the dogs begin to drool when he puts a harness on, before he gives them food
	- stimulus provokes a reflexive response
		- unconditioned stimulus
		- unconditioned response
		- neutral stimulus
		- conditioned stimulus
		- conditioned response
- **John Watson**: researched classical conditioning in the 1920s at JHU
	- **Little Albert**: white rat with loud noises
	- later goes into advertising and marketing
- **Edward Thorndike**: **Law of Effect** 
	- cat in the box with a lever
	- actions followed by favorable consequences are more likely to be repeated, actions followed by negative consequences less likely to be repeated
- **B. F. Skinner**: operant conditioning
	- refines the law of effect and names it operant conditioning
	- rewards introduce an increase in behavior, punishments introduce a decrease in behavior

Gestalt psychology: perception, how we take sensory information and make it meaningful
- field of cognitive psychology
- **Law of proximity**: group objects by distance
- **Law of similarity**: group alike objects
- **Law of closure**: fill in gaps with prior knowledge
- **Law of connectedness**: connected objects will be perceived as one object
- **Law of figure-groud**: to perceive an object, we must first see it as separate from the background

Contemporary fields of psychology:
- cognitive psychology: late 20th century, more relevant with increased technology
	- perception
	- human intelligence
	- language
	- thinking and problem solving
	- memory and attention

---

Contemporary approaches:
- behavioral: how we learn observable responses
	- classical and operant conditioning
- biological: how our genes and environment influence individual differences, how the body and brain enable emotions, memories, and sensory experiences
- cognitive: how we encode, process, store, and retrieve information
- evolutionary: how natural selection of traits has promoted survival of genes
- humanistic: how to achieve personal growth and self-fulfillment
- psychodynamic: how unconscious drives and conflicts influence us
- social-cultural: how behavior and thinking vary across different cultures
