### Hindsight bias

Hindsight bias - the tendency to believe, after learning an outcome, that one would have foreseen it
- "I knew it all along" phenomenon

Example:
- give half the member of a group some purported psychological finding and the other half an opposite result
- i.e. "psychologists have found that separation weakens romantic attraction", as per "out of sight, out of mind"
- and "psychologists have found that separation strengthens romantic attraction", as per "absence makes the heart grow fonder"
- both findings seem like common sese
- Common sense describes what has happened better than it predicts what will happen

### Overconfidence

Overconfidence - we tend to think more than we do

Example:
- anagram solutions
- is Boston north or south of Paris
- of more than 27k expert predictions of world events, which were made with 80% confidence on average, were right less than 40% of the time

### Perceiving order in random events

Random sequences often don't look random

---

These three tendencies lead us to overestimate the weight of common sense thinking

Scientific inquiry can help us overcome such biases and shortcomings
