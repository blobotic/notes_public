## *David Myers*. The Need of Psychological Science
[Top](#unit-2-research-methods)

### Hindsight bias

Hindsight bias - the tendency to believe, after learning an outcome, that one would have foreseen it
- "I knew it all along" phenomenon

Example:
- give half the member of a group some purported psychological finding and the other half an opposite result
- i.e. "psychologists have found that separation weakens romantic attraction", as per "out of sight, out of mind"
- and "psychologists have found that separation strengthens romantic attraction", as per "absence makes the heart grow fonder"
- both findings seem like common sese
- Common sense describes what has happened better than it predicts what will happen

### Overconfidence

Overconfidence - we tend to think more than we do

Example:
- anagram solutions
- is Boston north or south of Paris
- of more than 27k expert predictions of world events, which were made with 80% confidence on average, were right less than 40% of the time

### Perceiving order in random events

Random sequences often don't look random

---

These three tendencies lead us to overestimate the weight of common sense thinking

Scientific inquiry can help us overcome such biases and shortcomings

## *David Myers*. The Scientific Method
[Top](#unit-2-research-methods)

### The Scientific Method

Scientific method: a self-correcting process for evaluating ideas with observation and analysis
- combines curiosity, skepticism, and humility
- if predictions fail, the theory is revised or rejected

**theory** - an explanation using an integrated set of principles that organizes obesrvations and predicts behaviors or events
- organizes observations
- summarizes and simplifies

good theories produce testable predictions, **hypotheses**
- specify what results would support the theory and which would disconfirm it

**Operational definitions** - a carefully worded statement of the exact procedures (operations) used in a research study
- ex. human intelligence can be defined as what an intelligence test measures
- important for **replication** - repeating the essence of a research study, usually with different participants in differing situations, to see whether the basic finding can be reproduced
	- confirmation
	- lack of replication also lets us revise our understanding

So theories are useful if it
1. organizes observations
2. implies predictions that anyone can use to check the theory or derive practical applications
3. stimulate further research to lead to a revised theory, or be replicated & supported by similar findings

### Descriptive methods

- case studies (in-depth analyses of individuals or groups)
- naturalistic observations (recording the natural behavior of many individuals)
- surveys and interviews (asking people questions)

Case study - a descriptive technique in which one individual or group is studied in depth in the hope of revealing universal principles
- ex. brain damage
- ex. children's minds (Jean Piaget only observed and questioned a few children)
- ex. animal intelligence (studies of a few animals revealing their capacity for understanding and language, i.e. chimpanzees)

Individual cases can suggest ideas, but they can also mislead
- can't assume that case studies always reveal general principles that apply to us all

Naturalistic observation - a descriptive technique of obesrving and recording behavior in naturally occurring situations without trying to manipulate or control the situation
- historically "small science" (doesn't need fancy equipment or a big budget) , but technology has been enabling "big data" observations (Facebook, Twitter, Google)
- doesn't explain behavior, only describes it
- offers interesting snapashots/observations, but it does so without controlling for all the factors that may influence behavior

Survey - obtaining the self-reported attitudes or behaviors of a particular group, usually by questioning a representative, random sample of the group
- wording effects can affect people's expressed opinions
	- "aid to the needy" vs "welfare"
	- "not allowing" vs "censoring"
	- "gun safety" vs "gun control"
	- "revenue enhancers" vs "taxes"
- random sampling
	- **sampling bias** - a flawed sampling process that produces an unrepresentative sample
	- **population** - all those in a group being studied, from which samples may be drawn
	- **random sample** - a sample that fairly represents a population because each member has an equal chance of inclusion
	- large representative samples are better than smaller ones, but a smaller representative sample is better than a larger unrepresentative sample

## *David Myers*. Correlation and Experimentation
[Top](#unit-2-research-methods)

### Correlation

**correlation** - a measure of the extent to which two factors vary together, and thus of how well either factor predicts the other
- while it reveals relationships, it doesn't explain them
- correlation does not prove causation; there could be a third factor causing both variables

**correlation coefficient** - a statistical index of the relationship between two things (from -1.00 to +1.00)

**variable** - anything that can very and is feasible and ethical to measure

**scatterplot** - a graphed cluster of dots, each of which represents the values of 2 variables; the slope suggests the direction of the relationship between the 2 variables and the amount of scatter suggests the strength of the correlation
- positive/negative correlation (inverse?)
- can illuminate results that we don't notice as pure data alone or on a case-by-case basis

**illusory correlation** - perceiving a relationship where none exists, or perceiving a strong-than-actual relationship
- can feed an illusion of control, that chance events are subject to our personal control

**regression toward the mean** - the tendency for extreme or unusuall scores or events to fall back (regress) toward the average
- we sometimes attribute a normal regression to be something we have done
- when fluctuating behavior returns to normal, regression toward the mean is probably at work

### Experimentation

**experiment** - a research method in which an investigator manipulates independent variables to observe the effect on the dependent variable
- by random assignment of participants, the experimenter aims to control (hold constant) other relevant factors
- **experimental group** - the group exposed to the treatment
- **control group** - the group not exposed to the treatment, serves as a comparison for evaluating the effect of the treatment
- important to randomly assign people to the two conditions
- **random assignment** - assigning participants to experimental and control groups by chance, thus minimizing preexisting differences between the different groups
- experiments manipulate a variable to determine its effect

**double-blind procedure** - both the research participants and the research staff are blind about whether the research participants have received the treatment or a placebo

**placebo effect** - experimental results caused by expectations alone

**independent variable** - the factor that is manipulated

**confouding variable** - a factor other than the factor being studied that might influence a study's results

**dependent variable** - the outcome that is measured when the independent variable is manipulated

**validity** - the extent to which a test or experiment measures or predicts what it is supposed to

## *David Myers*. Research Design and Ethics
[Top](#unit-2-research-methods)

### Research Design

Descriptive
- to observe and record behavior
- case studies, naturalistic observations, surveys
- nothing is manipulated
- no control of variables, single cases may be misleading

Correlational 
- to detect naturally occurring relationships, to assess how well one variable predicts another
- collect data on 2+ variables
- nothing manipulated
- correlation $\neq$ causation

Experimental 
- to explore cause and effect
- random assignment
- manipulate the independent variables
- sometimes not feasible, results may not generalize, not ethical to manipulate certain variables

Research design:
- pick a testable, ethical question
- pick appropriate research design
- consider limitations: available money+time, ethical issues
- operational definition - how to measure the behavior/mental processes being studied
- consider confounding variables
- measure target behaviors and interpret results

### Understanding Everyday Behavior

An experiment's purpose is not to recreate exact behaviors of everyday life but to test theoretical principles that can be generalized
- general principles that explain many behaviors
- predict behaviors for groups of people but less strongly the behavior for an individual in any given situation

### Psychology's Research Ethics

Protecting research participants
- animals
	- is it right to place human well-being above that of other animals?
	- what safeguards should protect the well-being of animals in research?
	- British Psychological Society (BPS) guidelines - housing animals under reasonably natural living conditions
	- American Psychological Association (APA) guidelines - provide "humane care and healthful conditions", and testing should "minimize discomfort"
	- European Parliament - standards for animal care and housing
	- universities screen research proposals, often through an animal care ethics committee, and labs are regulated and inspected
	- animal research can also benefit animals (increase empathy + protection)
- humans
	- informed consent - giving potential participants enough information about a study to enable them to choose whether they wish to participate
	- protect participants from greater-than usual harm and discomfort
	- individual participant information confidentiality 
	- debrief - postexperimental explanation of a study, including its purpose and any deceptions, to its participants
	- ethics committees (institutional review boards)

### Values in Psychology

Labels describe and labels evaluate—they can reflect our values

"professional" guidance on how to live is value-laden advice

Concerns about psychology used to manipulate people
- it can deceive
- it can also enlighten

## *David Myers*. Statistics
[Top](#unit-2-research-methods)

### The Need for Statistics

Doubt big, round, undocumented numbers

Descriptive statistics - numerical data used to measure and descibre characteristics of groups
- measures of central tendency
- measures of variation

Histogram - a bar graph depicting a frequency distribution

Measures of central tendency - a single score to represent a whole set of scores
- mode - the most frequently occurring scores in a distribution
- mean - the arithmetic average of a distribution
- median - the midpoint, the 50th percentile
- similar in a bellcurve distribution

skewed distribution - a representation of scores that last symmetry around their average value

Measures of variation
- range - the difference between the highet and lowest scores in a distribution
- standard deviation - a computed measure of how much scores vary around the mean score

normal curve (normal distribution) - a symmetrical, bell-shaped curve that describes the distribution of many types of data; most scores fall near the mean (68% fall within 1 standard deviation of it) and fewer near the extremes
