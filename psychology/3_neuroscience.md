## *David Myers*. The Neuron

### Neurons

**neuron** - a nerve cell, the basic building block of the nervous system
- **cell body** - the part of a neuron that contains the nucleus, the cell's life support center
- and its branching **dendrite** fibers - a neuron's often bushy, branching extensions that receive and integrate messages, conducting impulses toward the cell body
- **axon** - the neuron extension that passes messages through its branches to other neurons or to muscles or glands
	- can be up to several feet long
- **myelin sheath** - a fatty tissue layer segmentally encasing the axons of some neurons, enabling vastly greater transmission speed as neural impulses hop from one node to the next
	- if the myelin sheath degenerates, **multiple sclerosis** results: communication to muscles slows, resulting in the loss of muscle control
- **glial cells (glia)** - cells in the nervous system that support, nourish, and protect neurons; they also play a role in learning, thinking, and memory
	- neurons can't feed or sheathe themselves
	- glial cells "chat" with neurons
	- the proportion of glia to neurons increases in more complex anima lbrains

So the cell body is the cell's life support center, the dendrites receive messages from other cells, the axon passes messages away from the cell body to other neurons, muscles, or glands, the terminal branches of the axon form junctions with other cells, the myelin sheath covers the axon of some neurons and helps speed neural impulses, and neural impulses are action potentials, electrical signals traveling down the axon. 

### The Neural Impulse

**action potential** - a neural impulse, a brief electrical charge that travels down an axon
- travels between 2 mph to over 200 mph
- significantly slower than electricity through a wire

generating electricity:
- the fluid outside of an axon's membrane is mostly positively charged sodium ions
- a resting axon's fluid interior has a mostly negative charge, consisting of large negatively charged protein ions and smaller, positively charged potassium ions
- the axon's surface is selectively permeable
- this positive/negative state is called the resting potential
- when the neuron fires, positive sodium ions flood into the axon through the now-open channels
- this depolarization causes the next set of axon channels to open, then the next
- the neural impulse is this temporary inflow of positive ions

most neural signals are excitatory, although some are inhibitory
- **threshold** - the level of stimulation required to trigger a neural impulse
- **refractory period** - a brief pause that occurs after a neuron has fired; subsequent action potentials can't occur until the axon returns to its resting state
- **all-or-none response** - neurons either fire with full strength or don't fire; the level of stimulation doesn't change intensity

### How neurons communicate

**synapse** - the junction between the axon tip of the sending neuron and the dendrite/cell body of the receiving neuron
- **synpatic gap/cleft** - the tiny gap at this junction
- when an action potential reaches the terminal branches of the axon, it triggers the release of **neurotransmitters** - chemical messengers that cross the synpatic gaps between neurons - that then bind to receptor sites on the receiving neuron
- the neurotransmitter unlocks tiny channels at the receiving site and electrically charged atoms flow in, exciting or inhibiting the receiving neuron's readiness to fire
- excess neurotransmitters drift away
	- broken down by enzymes
	- or **reputake** - a neurotransmitter's reabsorption by the sending neuron

### How neurotransmitters influence us

| Neurotransmitter | Function | Examples of malfunctions |
| --- | ---- | --- |
| Acetylcholine (ACh) | muscle action, learning, memory | Alzheimer's: ACh-producing neurons deteriorate | 
| Dopamine | movement, learning, attention, emotion | oversupply related to schizophrenia, undersupply linked to tremors and decreased mobility in Parkinson's disease |
| Serotonin | mood, hunger, sleep, arousal | undersupply linked to depression, some drugs that raise serotonin levels treat depression |
| Norepinephrine | controls alertness and arousal | undersupply can depress mood |
| GABA (gamma-aminobutyric acid) | a major inhibitory neurotransmitter | undersupply linked to seizures, tremors, insomnia |
| Glutamate | a major excitatory neurotransmitter, involved in memory | oversupply can overstimulate the brain, producing migraines/seizures |
| endorphins | perception of pain/pleasure | oversupply with opiate drugs can suppress endorphin supply |

A lack of ACh can paralyze us

**endorphins** - "morphine within"- natural, opiate-like neurotransmitters linked to pain control and to pleasure
- using opiates suppresses the brain's natural opiates, so when the drug is withdrawn, it leads to withdrawal symptoms

**agonist** molecules: increase a neurotransmitter's action
- increase production or release 
- block reuptake
- similar enough to bind to its receptor and imitate its excitatory/inhibitory effects
- example: opiates

**antagonists** - decrease a neurotransmitter's action
- blocks production or release
- similar enough to occupy its receptor site and block its effect, but not similar enough to stimulate the receptor
- example: paralyzing drugs

## *David Myers*. The Nervous System

**nervous system** - the body's speedy, electrochemical communication network, consisting of all the nerve cells of the peripheral and central nervous systems
- **peripheral nervous system (PNS)** - the sensory and motor neurons that connect the central nervous system to the rest of the body
	- **somatic nervous system** - the division of the PNS that controls the body's skeletal muscles. Also called the skeletal nervous system. 
	- **autonomic nervous system (ANS)** - the part of the peripheral nervous system that controls the glands and the muscles of the internal organs (i.e. heart). 
		- **sympathetic nervous system* - arouses and expends energy (fight or flight)
		- **parasympathetic nervous system** - conserves energy as it calms (rest and digest)
		- homeostasis - steady internal state that the sympathetic+parasympathetic nervous systems keep you in
- **central nervous system (CNS)** - the brain and spinal cord
	- brain - neurons cluster into neural networks to have short, fast connections
	- spinal cord - connects the PNS and the brain
		- ascending neural fibers send up sensory information
		- descending fibers send back motor-control information
		- ex. **reflexes** - a simple, automatic response to a sensory stimulus, i.e. knee-jerk response
		- ex. pain reflex - when burned, neural activity (excited by heat) travels via sensory neurons to interneurons in your spinal cord, that then activate motor neurons leading to the muscles in your arm, so your hand jerks away from the fire before your brain receives and responds to the information that causes you to feel pain

types of neurons:
- **sensory (afferent) neurons** - neurons that carry incoming information from the body's tissues and sensory receptors to the brain and spinal cord
- **motor (efferent) neurons** - neurons that carry outgoing information from the brain and spinal cord to the muscles and glands
- **interneurons** - neurons within the brain and spinal cord; they communicate internally and process information between the sensory inputs and motor outputs

**nerves** - bundled axons that form neural cables connecting the central nervous system with muscles, glands, and sense organs

### The endocrine system

**endocrine system** - the body's "slow" chemical communication system; a set of glands that secrete hormones into the bloodstream
- **hormones** - chemical messengers that are manufactured by the endocrine glands, travel through the bloodstream, and affect other tissues
	- can influence the brain
	- some are chemically identiacl to neurotransmitters
- endocrine messages are much slower than the nervous system, taking several seconds or more to travel from the gland to the target tissue
- endocrine messages tend to outlast the effects of neural messages
- **adrenal glands** - a pair of endocrine glands that sit just above the kidneys and secrete hormones (epinphrine and norepinephrine) that help arouse the body in times of stress
- **pituitary gland** - the endocrine system's most influential gland. under the influence of the hypothalamus, the pituitary gland regulates growth and controls other endocrine gland
	- releaases a growth hormone stimulating physical development
	- releases oxytocin, which enables contractions associated with birthing and milk flow during nursing as well as promoting pair bonding, group cohesion, and social trust
