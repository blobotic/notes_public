## *David Myers*. The Neuron
[Top](#unit-3-neuroscience)

### Neurons

**neuron** - a nerve cell, the basic building block of the nervous system
- **cell body** - the part of a neuron that contains the nucleus, the cell's life support center
- and its branching **dendrite** fibers - a neuron's often bushy, branching extensions that receive and integrate messages, conducting impulses toward the cell body
- **axon** - the neuron extension that passes messages through its branches to other neurons or to muscles or glands
	- can be up to several feet long
- **myelin sheath** - a fatty tissue layer segmentally encasing the axons of some neurons, enabling vastly greater transmission speed as neural impulses hop from one node to the next
	- if the myelin sheath degenerates, **multiple sclerosis** results: communication to muscles slows, resulting in the loss of muscle control
- **glial cells (glia)** - cells in the nervous system that support, nourish, and protect neurons; they also play a role in learning, thinking, and memory
	- neurons can't feed or sheathe themselves
	- glial cells "chat" with neurons
	- the proportion of glia to neurons increases in more complex anima lbrains

So the cell body is the cell's life support center, the dendrites receive messages from other cells, the axon passes messages away from the cell body to other neurons, muscles, or glands, the terminal branches of the axon form junctions with other cells, the myelin sheath covers the axon of some neurons and helps speed neural impulses, and neural impulses are action potentials, electrical signals traveling down the axon. 

### The Neural Impulse

**action potential** - a neural impulse, a brief electrical charge that travels down an axon
- travels between 2 mph to over 200 mph
- significantly slower than electricity through a wire

generating electricity:
- the fluid outside of an axon's membrane is mostly positively charged sodium ions
- a resting axon's fluid interior has a mostly negative charge, consisting of large negatively charged protein ions and smaller, positively charged potassium ions
- the axon's surface is selectively permeable
- this positive/negative state is called the resting potential
- when the neuron fires, positive sodium ions flood into the axon through the now-open channels
- this depolarization causes the next set of axon channels to open, then the next
- the neural impulse is this temporary inflow of positive ions

most neural signals are excitatory, although some are inhibitory
- **threshold** - the level of stimulation required to trigger a neural impulse
- **refractory period** - a brief pause that occurs after a neuron has fired; subsequent action potentials can't occur until the axon returns to its resting state
- **all-or-none response** - neurons either fire with full strength or don't fire; the level of stimulation doesn't change intensity

### How neurons communicate

**synapse** - the junction between the axon tip of the sending neuron and the dendrite/cell body of the receiving neuron
- **synpatic gap/cleft** - the tiny gap at this junction
- when an action potential reaches the terminal branches of the axon, it triggers the release of **neurotransmitters** - chemical messengers that cross the synpatic gaps between neurons - that then bind to receptor sites on the receiving neuron
- the neurotransmitter unlocks tiny channels at the receiving site and electrically charged atoms flow in, exciting or inhibiting the receiving neuron's readiness to fire
- excess neurotransmitters drift away
	- broken down by enzymes
	- or **reputake** - a neurotransmitter's reabsorption by the sending neuron

	### How neurotransmitters influence us

| Neurotransmitter | Function | Examples of malfunctions |
| --- | ---- | --- |
| Acetylcholine (ACh) | muscle action, learning, memory | Alzheimer's: ACh-producing neurons deteriorate | 
| Dopamine | movement, learning, attention, emotion | oversupply related to schizophrenia, undersupply linked to tremors and decreased mobility in Parkinson's disease |
| Serotonin | mood, hunger, sleep, arousal | undersupply linked to depression, some drugs that raise serotonin levels treat depression |
| Norepinephrine | controls alertness and arousal | undersupply can depress mood |
| GABA (gamma-aminobutyric acid) | a major inhibitory neurotransmitter | undersupply linked to seizures, tremors, insomnia |
| Glutamate | a major excitatory neurotransmitter, involved in memory | oversupply can overstimulate the brain, producing migraines/seizures |
| endorphins | perception of pain/pleasure | oversupply with opiate drugs can suppress endorphin supply |

A lack of ACh can paralyze us

**endorphins** - "morphine within"- natural, opiate-like neurotransmitters linked to pain control and to pleasure
- using opiates suppresses the brain's natural opiates, so when the drug is withdrawn, it leads to withdrawal symptoms

**agonist** molecules: increase a neurotransmitter's action
- increase production or release 
- block reuptake
- similar enough to bind to its receptor and imitate its excitatory/inhibitory effects
- example: opiates

**antagonists** - decrease a neurotransmitter's action
- blocks production or release
- similar enough to occupy its receptor site and block its effect, but not similar enough to stimulate the receptor
- example: paralyzing drugs

## *David Myers*. The Nervous System
[Top](#unit-3-neuroscience)

**nervous system** - the body's speedy, electrochemical communication network, consisting of all the nerve cells of the peripheral and central nervous systems
- **peripheral nervous system (PNS)** - the sensory and motor neurons that connect the central nervous system to the rest of the body
	- **somatic nervous system** - the division of the PNS that controls the body's skeletal muscles. Also called the skeletal nervous system. 
	- **autonomic nervous system (ANS)** - the part of the peripheral nervous system that controls the glands and the muscles of the internal organs (i.e. heart). 
		- **sympathetic nervous system* - arouses and expends energy (fight or flight)
		- **parasympathetic nervous system** - conserves energy as it calms (rest and digest)
		- homeostasis - steady internal state that the sympathetic+parasympathetic nervous systems keep you in
- **central nervous system (CNS)** - the brain and spinal cord
	- brain - neurons cluster into neural networks to have short, fast connections
	- spinal cord - connects the PNS and the brain
		- ascending neural fibers send up sensory information
		- descending fibers send back motor-control information
		- ex. **reflexes** - a simple, automatic response to a sensory stimulus, i.e. knee-jerk response
		- ex. pain reflex - when burned, neural activity (excited by heat) travels via sensory neurons to interneurons in your spinal cord, that then activate motor neurons leading to the muscles in your arm, so your hand jerks away from the fire before your brain receives and responds to the information that causes you to feel pain

types of neurons:
- **sensory (afferent) neurons** - neurons that carry incoming information from the body's tissues and sensory receptors to the brain and spinal cord
- **motor (efferent) neurons** - neurons that carry outgoing information from the brain and spinal cord to the muscles and glands
- **interneurons** - neurons within the brain and spinal cord; they communicate internally and process information between the sensory inputs and motor outputs

**nerves** - bundled axons that form neural cables connecting the central nervous system with muscles, glands, and sense organs

### The endocrine system

**endocrine system** - the body's "slow" chemical communication system; a set of glands that secrete hormones into the bloodstream
- **hormones** - chemical messengers that are manufactured by the endocrine glands, travel through the bloodstream, and affect other tissues
	- can influence the brain
	- some are chemically identiacl to neurotransmitters
- endocrine messages are much slower than the nervous system, taking several seconds or more to travel from the gland to the target tissue
- endocrine messages tend to outlast the effects of neural messages
- **adrenal glands** - a pair of endocrine glands that sit just above the kidneys and secrete hormones (epinphrine and norepinephrine) that help arouse the body in times of stress
- **pituitary gland** - the endocrine system's most influential gland. under the influence of the hypothalamus, the pituitary gland regulates growth and controls other endocrine gland
	- releaases a growth hormone stimulating physical development
	- releases oxytocin, which enables contractions associated with birthing and milk flow during nursing as well as promoting pair bonding, group cohesion, and social trust

Examining the head
- case studies localized some functions (damage caused numbness or paralysis on the body's opposite side, damage to the back disrupted vision, damage to the left-front produced speech difficulties)
- **lesion** - a naturally or experimentally caused destruction of brain tissue
- stimulate various parts, electrically, chemically, or magnetically
- microelectrodes for individual neurons, or overall neuron activity
- **EEG (electroencephalogram)** - an amplified recording of the waves of electrical activity sweeping across the brain's surface, measured by electrodes placed on the scalp
- **MEG (magnetoencephalography)** - measures magnetic fields from the brain's natural electrical activity in special rooms that cancel out other magnetic signals
- **CT (computed tomography) scan** - a series of X-ray photographs taken from different angles and combined by computer into a composite representation of a slice of the brain's structure
- **PET (positron emission tomography) scan** - a visual display of brain activity that detects where a radioactive form of glucose goes while the brain performs a given task

	- when the brain is unoccupied, blood flows via the default network (mind-wandering, daydreaming)
	- brains are most active when people feel pain/rejection, listen to angry voices, think about scary things, feel happy, or become sexually excited
- brain connectivity - how brain regions communicate
	- people with major depressive disorder tend to show low connectivity between brain regions involved in experiencing emotion and emotion regulation

### Older brain structures

The following functions occur without any conscious effort
- our brain processes most information outside of our awareness

**brainstem** - the oldest and central core of the brain, beginning at the medulla; responsible for automatic survival functions (heartbeat, breathing, heart's pumping)
- **medulla** - base of the brainstem; the slight swelling in the spinal cord just after it enters the skull; controls heartbeat and breathing
- pons - above the medulla, coordinates movements and control sleep
- crossover point - where most nerves from each side of the brain connects with the body's opposite side

**thalamus** - a pair of egg-shaped structures above the brainstem that act as the brain's sensory control center; directs messages to the sensory receiving areas in the cortex and transmits replies to the cerebellum and medulla

**reticular formation** - inside the brainstem between your ears; a nerve network that travels through the brainstem into the thalamus; filters incoming stimuli and relays miportant information to other brain areas (multitasking); controls arousal

**cerebellum** - the "little brain" at the rear of the brainstem
- enables nonverbal learning and skll memory
- helps us judge time, modulate our emotions, and discriminate sounds and textures
- (with the pons) coordinates voluntary movement

### The limbic system

**limbic system** - (limbus, "border") the neural system (including the amygdala, hypothalamus, and hippocampus) located below the cerebral hemispheres; associated with emotions and drives

**amygdala** - two lima-bean sized neural clusters; linked to emotion (aggression and fear)

**hypothalamus** - lying below (hypo) the thalamus; directs several maintenance activities (eating, drinking, body temperature), helps govern the endocrine system via the pituitary gland, and is linked to emotion and reward
- helps maintain homeostasis
- tunes into your blood chemistry and any incoming orders from other brain parts to trigger the pituitary gland to release their hormones
- other limbic reward centers are the nucleus accumbens in front of the hypothalamus
- stimulating reward circuits produces more desire than pure enjoyment in humans
- dopamine release = pleasure

**hippocampus** - a seahorse-shaped brain structure that processes conscious, explicit memories and decreases in size and function as we grow older

## *David Myers*. The Cerebral Cortex
[Top](#unit-3-neuroscience)

*cerebrum** - two cerebral hemispheres contributing 85% of the brainś weigh

**cerebral cortex** - the intricate fabric of interconnected neural cells coverng the cerebral hemispheres; the bodyś ultimate control and information processing center
- expands as an organism's adaptability increases

### Structure of the cortex

hemisphere divided into four lobes separated by fissures (folds)
- **frontal lobes** - the portion of the cerebral cortex lying juts behind the forehead; involved in speaking and muscle movements and in making plans and judgments
- **parietal lobes** - the portion of the cerebral cortex lying at the top of the head and toward the rear; receives sensory input for touch and body position
- **occipital lobes** - the portion of the cerebral cortex lying at the back of the head; includes areas that receive information from the visual fields
- **temporal lobes** - the portion of the cerebral cortex lying roughly above the ears; includes the auditory areas, each receiving information primarily from the opposite ear

### Function of the Cortex

motor functions:
- **motor cortex** - an area at the rear of the frontal lobes that controls voluntary movement, on the opposite side of the body
- mapped by stimulating diferent cortical areas and observing responses
- brain-computer interfaces for paralyzed patients (tested on monkeys)
	- also for speech/language/concepts
	- cognitive neural prosthetics

sensory functions:
- **somatosensory cortex** - an area at the front of the parietal lobes that registers and processes body touch and movement sensations
- the more sensitive, the larger the somatosensory cortex area devoted to it
- visual information goes to the visual cortex in your occipital lobes at the back of your brain
- sound processed by auditory cortex in temporal lobes juts above your ears
	- auditory information travles in a circuitous route from one ear to the auditory receiving area above your opposite ear

**association areas** - areas of the cerebral cortex that are not involved in primary motor or sensory functions; rather, they are involved in higher mental functions such as learning, remembering, thinking, and speaking
- found in all four lobes
- prefrontal cortex in the forward part of the frontal lobes - enables judgment, planning, and processing of new memories
	- Phineas Gage
	- Cecil Clayton
	- damage can cause people to become les inhibited and more impulsive and disconnect them from their moral compass
- parietal lobes enable mathematical and spatial reasoning
- underside of the right temporal lobe enables us to recognize faces
- many islands of brain activity work together during a complex task

### The power of plasticity

**plasticity** - the brain's ability to change, especially during childhood, by reorganizing after damage or by building new pathways based on experience

response to damage:
- causes for brain-damage effects
	- severed brain and spinal cord neurons don't regenerate (permanent paralysis)
	- some brain functions preassigned to specific areas
- some tissue can reorganize after serious damage, especially in young children
	- good for the blind or deaf
	- also happens when disease or damage frees up other brain areas normally dedicated to specific functions
- **neurogenesis** - the formation of new neurons
	- master stem cells that can develop into any type of brain cell have been discovered


## *David Myers*. Brain Hemisphere
[Top](#unit-3-neuroscience)

lateralization - left and right hemispheres esrve different functions
- left hemisphere accidents can impair reading, writing, speaking, arithmetic reasoning, and understanding
- similar right hemisphere damage has less visibly dramatic effects

**corpus callosum** - the large band of neural fibers connecting the two brain hemispheres and carrying messages between them
- **split brain** - a condition resulting from surgery that isolates the brain's two hemispheres by cutting the fibers (mainly those of the corpus callosum) connecting them
	- surprisingly normal
	- but they could quiz each hemisphere separately; ex. patients can answer that they saw a word in their right visual field (so left hemisphere) then would point with their left hand (right hemisphere)
	- both hemispheres act independently
	- left hemisphere can make up scenarios to rationalize reactions from the right hemisphere that it doesn't understand
- perceptual task = increased activity in the right hemisphere; speaking/math calculation = increased activity in the left hemisphere
- hemispheric specialization happens when surgeons inject sedatives into the patients' arteries

the left hemisphere makes quick, literal interpretations of language

the right hemisphere
- excels in making inferences
- helps us modulate our speech to make meaning clear
-  helps orchestrate our self-awareness

### The biology of consciousness

**consciousness** - our subjective awareness of ourselves and our environments
- helps us cope with novel situations and act in our long-term interests
- **cognitive neuroscience** - the interdisciplinary study of the brain activity linked with cognition (including perception, thinking, memory, and language)
- patients have meaningful though diminished brain responses to questions, even if their body is motionless
- conscious experiences arise from synchronized activity across the brain

**dual processing** - the principle that information is often simultaneously processed on separate conscious and unconscious tracks
- **blindsight** - a condition in which a person can respond to a visual stimulus without consciously experiencing it
	- damage occurs in the area associated with consciously recognizing objects
	- visual perception track and a visual action track
- **parallel processing** - processing many aspects of a problem simultaneously; generally used to process well-learned information or to solve easy problems
- **sequential processing** - processing one aspect of a problem at a time; generally used to process new information or to solve difficult problems
