## *David Myers*. The Neuron

### Neurons

**neuron** - a nerve cell, the basic building block of the nervous system
- **cell body** - the part of a neuron that contains the nucleus, the cell's life support center
- and its branching **dendrite** fibers - a neuron's often bushy, branching extensions that receive and integrate messages, conducting impulses toward the cell body
- **axon** - the neuron extension that passes messages through its branches to other neurons or to muscles or glands
	- can be up to several feet long
- **myelin sheath** - a fatty tissue layer segmentally encasing the axons of some neurons, enabling vastly greater transmission speed as neural impulses hop from one node to the next
	- if the myelin sheath degenerates, **multiple sclerosis** results: communication to muscles slows, resulting in the loss of muscle control
- **glial cells (glia)** - cells in the nervous system that support, nourish, and protect neurons; they also play a role in learning, thinking, and memory
	- neurons can't feed or sheathe themselves
	- glial cells "chat" with neurons
	- the proportion of glia to neurons increases in more complex anima lbrains

So the cell body is the cell's life support center, the dendrites receive messages from other cells, the axon passes messages away from the cell body to other neurons, muscles, or glands, the terminal branches of the axon form junctions with other cells, the myelin sheath covers the axon of some neurons and helps speed neural impulses, and neural impulses are action potentials, electrical signals traveling down the axon. 

### The Neural Impulse

**action potential** - a neural impulse, a brief electrical charge that travels down an axon
- travels between 2 mph to over 200 mph
- significantly slower than electricity through a wire

generating electricity:
- the fluid outside of an axon's membrane is mostly positively charged sodium ions
- a resting axon's fluid interior has a mostly negative charge, consisting of large negatively charged protein ions and smaller, positively charged potassium ions
- the axon's surface is selectively permeable
- this positive/negative state is called the resting potential
- when the neuron fires, positive sodium ions flood into the axon through the now-open channels
- this depolarization causes the next set of axon channels to open, then the next
- the neural impulse is this temporary inflow of positive ions

most neural signals are excitatory, although some are inhibitory
- **threshold** - the level of stimulation required to trigger a neural impulse
- **refractory period** - a brief pause that occurs after a neuron has fired; subsequent action potentials can't occur until the axon returns to its resting state
- **all-or-none response** - neurons either fire with full strength or don't fire; the level of stimulation doesn't change intensity

### How neurons communicate

**synapse** - the junction between the axon tip of the sending neuron and the dendrite/cell body of the receiving neuron
- **synpatic gap/cleft** - the tiny gap at this junction
- when an action potential reaches the terminal branches of the axon, it triggers the release of **neurotransmitters** - chemical messengers that cross the synpatic gaps between neurons - that then bind to receptor sites on the receiving neuron
- the neurotransmitter unlocks tiny channels at the receiving site and electrically charged atoms flow in, exciting or inhibiting the receiving neuron's readiness to fire
- excess neurotransmitters drift away
	- broken down by enzymes
	- or **reputake** - a neurotransmitter's reabsorption by the sending neuron

### How neurotransmitters influence us

| Neurotransmitter | Function | Examples of malfunctions |
| --- | ---- | --- |
| Acetylcholine (ACh) | muscle action, learning, memory | Alzheimer's: ACh-producing neurons deteriorate | 
| Dopamine | movement, learning, attention, emotion | oversupply related to schizophrenia, undersupply linked to tremors and decreased mobility in Parkinson's disease |
| Serotonin | mood, hunger, sleep, arousal | undersupply linked to depression, some drugs that raise serotonin levels treat depression |
| Norepinephrine | controls alertness and arousal | undersupply can depress mood |
| GABA (gamma-aminobutyric acid) | a major inhibitory neurotransmitter | undersupply linked to seizures, tremors, insomnia |
| Glutamate | a major excitatory neurotransmitter, involved in memory | oversupply can overstimulate the brain, producing migraines/seizures |
| endorphins | perception of pain/pleasure | oversupply with opiate drugs can suppress endorphin supply |

A lack of ACh can paralyze us

**endorphins** - "morphine within"- natural, opiate-like neurotransmitters linked to pain control and to pleasure
- using opiates suppresses the brain's natural opiates, so when the drug is withdrawn, it leads to withdrawal symptoms

**agonist** molecules: increase a neurotransmitter's action
- increase production or release 
- block reuptake
- similar enough to bind to its receptor and imitate its excitatory/inhibitory effects
- example: opiates

**antagonists** - decrease a neurotransmitter's action
- blocks production or release
- similar enough to occupy its receptor site and block its effect, but not similar enough to stimulate the receptor
- example: paralyzing drugs
