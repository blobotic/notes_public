# Learning and Thinking

**learning** - the process of acquiring through experience new and relatively enduring information or behaviors

**classical conditioning**
**operant conditioning**
**cognitive learning** - the acquisition of mental information, whether by observing events, by watching others, or through language, that you've never experienced or seen

**habituation** - decreasing responsiveness with repeated exposure to a stimulus

**associative learning** - learning that certain events occur together, can be either two stimuli (classical conditioning) or a response and its consequence (operant conditioning)

**respondent behavior** - behavior that occurs as an automatic response to some stimulus

**operant behavior** - behavior that operates on the environment, producing consequences

**acquisition** - in classical conditioning, when one links a neutral stimulus and an unconditioned stimulus so that the neutral stimulus begins triggering the conditioned response. In operant conditioning, the strengthening of a reinforced response

**higher-order conditioning** - a conditioning experience is paired with a new neutral stimulus, creating a second (often weaker) conditioned stimulus

**extinction** - the diminishing of a conditioned response 

**spontaneous recovery** - the reappearance of an extinguished conditioned response

**generalization** - the tendency for stimuli similar to the conditioned stimulus to elicit similar responses

**discrimination** - the learned ability to distinguish between a conditioned stimulus and similar stimuli that do not signal an unconditioned stimulus

**positive reinforcement** - adds a desirable stimulus
**negative reinforcement** - removes an aversive stimulus
**positive punishment** - add an aversive stimulus
**negative punishment** - remove a rewarding stimulus

**reinforcement schedule** - how often a desired response is reinforced
- **continuous reinforcement schedule**
- **partial/intermittent reinforcement schedule**

Skinner's four schedules:
- **fixed-ratio schedules** (after a specific number of responses)
- **variable-ratio schedules** (after an unpredictable number of responses)
- **fixed-interval schedules** (after a time period)
- **variable-interval schedules** (unpredictable time intervals)

**preparedness** - a biological predisposition to learn associations, such as between taste and nausea, that have survival value

**John Garcia** - rats and water

**instinctive drift** - the tendency of learned behavior to gradually revert to biologically predisposed patterns

**cognitive map** - a mental representation of the layout of one's environment

**latent learning** - learning that occurs but is not apparent until there is an incentive to demonstrate it

**insight** - sudden realization of a problem's solution, in contrast to strategy-based solutions

**intrinsic motivation** - a desire to perform a behavior effectively for its own sake
**extrinsic motivation** - a desire to perform a behavior to receive promised rewards or avoid threatened punishment

**problem-focused coping** - attempting to alleviate stress directly, by changing the stressor or the way we interact with that stressor
**emotion-focused coping** - attempting to alleviate stress by avoiding/ignoring a stressor and attending to emotional needs related
**personal control** - our sense of controlling our own environment rather than feeling helpless

**external locus of control** - the perception that chance or outside forces beyond our personal control determine our fate
**internal locus of control** - the perception that we control our own fate

**self-control** - the ability to control impulses and delay short-term gratification for greater long-term rewards

**learned helplessness** - the hopelessness and passive resignation an animal/person learns when unable to avoid repeated aversive events

**Edward Thorndike** - **Law of Effect** - behaviors followed by favorable consequences become more likely, and behaviors followed by unfavorable consequences become less likely

**Metacognition** - thinking about thinking

**cognition** - all the mental activities associated with thinking, knowing, remembering, and communicating

**concepts** - a mental grouping of similar objects, events, ideas, or people
- **definitions** - some concepts fit into a group b/c of their definition

obstacles to problem-solving:
- **fixation** - having a preoccupation with something, not being able to stop thinking of it
- **mental set** - the tendnecy to continue using belief systems and problem-solving strataegies that have worked in the past, even though it may not be orking now
- **functional fixedness** - the tendency to think of an object as functioning only in its usual/customary way, so you don't see unusual or innovative uses of unfamiliar objects
- **availability heuristic** - judging the likelihood of an event based on readily available personal experiences/news reports
- **representative heuristic** - judging the likelihood of an event based on how well it matches a typical example
- **anchoring effect** - the tendency to be influenced by a reference point
- **framing** - posing a question or wording a phrase in such a way to persuade someone's thoughts
- **bias** - preexisting positions/beliefs about events/people
	- **confirmation bias** - preference for information that confirms preexisting positions or beliefs while ignoring or discouting contradictory evidence
	- **belief perserverence** - holding onto a belief even after its been discredited
	- **hindsight bias** 
	- **overconfidence bias** - more confident than correct
	- **exaggerated fear** - overly fearful of something to the point of a phobia, related to availability heuristic

critical thinking
- **brainstorm**
- **creativity** ( the ability to think about a problem or idea in new and unusual ways, come up with unconventional solutions to problems)
- **divergent thinking** (alternative approaches + multiple solutions, taking risks)
- **convergent thinking** (logic and algorithm, only one answer, no other perspective)
- **inductive reasoning** - specific->general
- **deductive reasoning** - general->specific

# Memory

**memory** - the persistence of learning over time through the encoding, storage, and retrieval of information

**recall** - retrieve information
**recognition** - identify items previously learned
**relearning** - time saved when learning material again

**encoding** - the process of getting information into the memory system
**storage** - the process of retaining encoded information over time
**retrieval** - the process of getting information out of memory storage

**parallel processing** - processing many aspects of a problem simultaneously, the brain's natural mode of information processing for many functions

**Richard Atkinson and Richard Shiffrin's three stage model**
- **sensory memory** - the immediate brief recording of sensory information in the memory system
- **short-term memory** - activated memory that holds a few items briefly before the information is stored or forgotten
- **long-term memory** - the relatively permanent and limitless storehouse of the memory system, includes knowledge, skills, and experiences

**working memory** - a newer understanding of short-term memory that adds conscious, active processing of incoming auditory and visual information, and of information retrieved from long-term memory
- links new input with long-term memories
- and processes already stored information
- **Alan Baddeley**
- **auditory rehearsal**

**declarative/explicit memory** - retention of facts and experiences that one can consciously know and "declare" 
**effortful processing** - encoding that requires attention and conscious effort
**automatic processing** - unconscious encoding of incidental information, such as space, time, and frequency, and of well-learned information, such as word meanings
**nondeclarative/implicit memory** - retention of learned skills or classically conditioned associations independent of conscious recollection

**iconic memory** - a momentary sensory memory of visual stimuli; a picture-image memory lasting no more than a few tenths of a second
**echoic memory** - a momentary sensory memory of an auditory stimuli; if attention if elsewhere, sounds and words can still be recalled within 3 or 4 sentences

**Miller:**
- short term memory capacity is $7\pm2$

**chunking** - organizing items into familiar, manageable units; a chunk is a unit of meaningful information, often occurs automatically

**mnemonics** - memory aids, especially those techniques that use vivid imagery and organizational devices

**hierarchies** - a few broad concepts divided and subdivided into narrower concepts and facts

**spacing effect** - the tendency for distributed study/practice to yield better long-term retention than is achieved through massed study/practice

**testing effect** - self-testing/testing improves memory, enhanced memory after retrieving information

**shallow processing** - encoding on a basic level, based on the structure/appearance of words
**deep processing** - encoding semantically, based on the meaning of the words; tends to yield the best retention


**semantic memory** - explicit memory of facts and general knowledge
**episodic memory** - explicit memory of personally experienced events

**hippocampus** - helps process explicit (conscious) memories (of facts and events) for storage

**memory consolidation** - the neural storage of a long-term memory

**cerebellum** - forms and stores the implicit memories created by classical conditioning

**basal ganglia** - involved in motor movement and formation of procedural memories for skills

**infantile amnesia** - our conscious memory of our first four years is largely blank

**flashbulb memory** - a clear, sustained memory of an emotionally significant moment or event

**long-term potentiation (LTP)** - an increase in a cell's firing potential after brief, rapid stimulation: a neural basis for learning and memory

**priming** - the activation, often unconsciously, of particular associations in memory

**encoding specificity principle** - the idea that cues and contexts specific to a particular memory will be most effective in helping us recall it
- context-dependent memories

**mood-congruent memory** - the tendency to recall experiences that are consistent with one's current good or bad mood
- state-dependent memory

**serial position effect** - our tendency to recall best the last (recency effect) and first (primacy) effect items in a list

HM: removed hippocampus to stop persistent seizures, he was unable to form new conscious memories 

**anterograde amnesia** - the inability to form new memories
**retrograde amnesia** - the inability to retrieve information from one's past

**Ebbinghaus' forgetting curve** - storage failure

**proactive interference** - the disruptive effect of older learning on the recall of new information
**retroactive interference** - the backward-acting disruptive effect of newer learning on the recall of old learning

**repression** - the basic defense mechanism that banishes from consciousness anxiety-arousing thoughts, feelings, and memories

**reconsolidation** - previous stored memories, when retrieved, are potentially altered before being stored again

**misinformation effect** - occurs when misleading information has distorted one's memory of an event
- imagined events can seem real

**source amnesia/misattribution** - faulty memory for how, when, or where information was learned or imagined
- false memories

**deja vu** - the sense that I've experienced this before; cues from the current situation may unconsciously trigger retrieval of an earlier experience

**next-in-line effect** - a person in a group has diminished recall for the words of others who spoke immediately before or after the person

**overlearning** - the additional rehearsal of information after learning that improves retention

**visual encoding** - the encoding of pictures/images
**acoustic encoding** - the encoding of sound, especially the sound of words

**rosy retrospection** - recalling the high points of an event while forgetting the mundane ones
