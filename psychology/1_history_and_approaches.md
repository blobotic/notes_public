## The Evolution of Psychology: History, Approaches, and Questions
[Top](#unit-1-history-and-approaches)

Change in the field of psychology
- moved from speculation about behavior toward a more objective and scientific approach as technology has improved
- increasing influx of women into the field

The most important approaches (schools) of psychology:
| School | Description | Important contributors |
| ------ | ----------- | ---------------------- |
| Structuralism | Introspection to identify structures of psychological experience | Wilhelm Wundt, Edward B. Titchener |
| Functionalism | why animals/humans have developed particular psychological aspects | William James |
| Psychodynamic | role of unconscious thoughts/feelings/memories and early childhood | Sigmund Freud, Carl Jung, Alfred Adler, Erik Erickson |
| Behaviorism | mind impossible to study, so only behavior should be studied | John B. Watson, B. F. Skinner |
| Cognitive | study of mental processes (perception, thinking, memory, judgments) | Hermann Ebbinghaus, Sir Frederic Bartlett, Jean Piaget |
| Social-cultural | social situations and how cultures influence thinking and behavior | Fritz Heider, Leon Festinger, Stanley Schachter |

Famous philosophers:
- Plato (428-347 BC), Greek - argued for nature
- Aristotle (384-322 BC), Greek - argued for nurture
	- tabula rasa - "empty slate"
- Thomas Hobbes (1588-1679), English
- Rene Descartes (1596-1650), French
	- argued for free will, believing that the mind controls the body through the pineal gland (wrong)
	- existence of innate natural abilities
	- dissected animals
	- nerves controlled the muscles
	- dualism - the mind is different from the mechanical body
- John Locke (1632-1704), English
- Jean-Jacques Rousseau (1712-1778), French
- Gustave Fechner (1801-1887), German - just noticeable difference, first empirical psychological measurement
- Charles Darwin (1809-1882), British - natural selection, influenced functionalist school and evolutionary psychology
- Wilhelm Wundt (1832-1920), German - structuralism and one of first psychology labs (Leipzig, Germany)
- William James (1842-1910), American - functionalism, one of first psych labs (Harvard University)
- Ivan Pavlov (1849-1936), Russian - classical conditioning
- Hermann Ebbinghaus (1850-1909), German - remember lists of nonsense syllables
- Sigmund Freud (1856-1939), Austrian - psychodynamic psychology
- Edward Bradford Titchener (1867-1927), American - structuralism
	- student of Wundt
	- founded a laboratory at Cornell University

Issues:
- Nature vs nurture
	- heritibility of characteristics (proportion of observed differences that is due to genetics)
		- intelligence high heritability (0.85)
		- extraversion is 0.50
- Free will vs determinism
- Accuracy vs inaccuracy (in human judgment)
- Conscious vs unconscious processing 
- Differences vs similarities (gender, culture, ethnicities, backgrounds, environments)

Structuralism: identify basic elements/structures of psychological experience
- create a periodic table of elements of sensations
- used introspection: asking research participants to describe what they experience
- reaction time instruments
- Wundt discovered difference between the sensation and perception of a sitmulus
- Tichtener claimed to have identified over 40,000 sensations
- rigorous and scientific
- limitations of introspection: subjective experiences

Functionalism/evolutionary psychology: why humans and animals have developed the particular psychological aspects they currently possess
- James: thinking only relevant to behavior
- Charles Darwin's natural selection and its applications to psychology
- today, functionalism is dead, but evolutionary psychology remains
	- evolutionary psychology: applies Darwinian theory to behavior
	- idea that many human psychological systems serve key adaptive functions
- fitness: extent of which a characteristic helps an organism survive and reproduce at a higher rate
- limitations: predictions are difficult to test, so we're just fitting data

Psychodynamic psychology: understanding human behavior based on unconscious thoughts, feelings, and memories
- Freud believed in the influence of painful childhood experiences that people couldn't remember
- Carl Jung, Alfred Adler, Karen Horney, Erik Erikson - possible to help patients if unconscious drives can be remembered
- psychoanalysis (talk therapy, dream analysis, etc)
- exploration of sexual experiences

Behaviorism: not possible to objectively study the mind, so study should be limited to behavior
- the mind is a "black box" - stimuli and responses
- Pavlov's dogs
- Watson: Little Albert and the white rat
- Skinner: rewards and reinforcements, theories on how to teach children and create more peaceful and productive societies

Free will:
- misperception of free will
- more likely to believe when
	- desire occurs immediately prior to the outcome
	- thought consistent with outcome
	- no other apparent causes for the behavior
- different context in which we take ownership for our actions: successes and failures

Cognitive psychology: studies mental processes (perception, thinking, memory, and judgment) 
- began in ernest in the 1960s
- Barlett studied the cognitive and social processes of remembering
	- difficult to recall unexpected stories - memory is influenced by what we already know
- behavior is not sufficient because people interpret the stimuli that they experience
- neuroimaging: use of techniques to provide images of the structure and function of the brain

Social-cultural psychology: study of how social situations and cultures influence thinking and behavior
- how people perceive themselves and others and how people influence each other's behavior
- social norms: ways of thinking/feeling/behaving shared by group members and perceived as appropriate
- culture: common set of social norms

Disciplines of psychology:
- biopsychology and neuroscience
- clinical and counseling psychology
- cognitive psychology
- developmental psychology
- forensic psychology
- health psychology
- industrial-organizational and environmental psychology
- personality psychology
- school and educational psychology
- social and cross-cultural psychology
- sports psychology

## Freud
[Top](#unit-1-history-and-approaches)

Freud's fundamental idea was human subconscious is defined by sexual/aggressive drives vs defenses against them

- most interesting mysteries lay in the mind
- by the 1890s, he mainly specialized in "neurasthenics" (severe hysterics)
- wrote down dreams, used introspection by both his parents and himself

Freud's *The Interpretation of Dreams* (1900) made his reputation
- mental experiences and entities are a part of nature, so even unconscious actions have meaning

*Three Essays on the Theory of Sexuality* (1905) alienated him from mainstream psychology but found other arden supporters
- Vienna Psychoanalytic Society in 1908
- two best known "defectors":
- Alfred Adler, a Viennese physician and sociologist
	- inferiority complex
- Carl Jung, a Swiss Protestant
	- Freud viewed him as his "crown prince"/successor
	- his ambition and growing commitment to religion drove them apart
	- Freud was an aggressive atheist

Freud wanted to develop the rules of psychoanalytic therapy and expand his picture of human nature to encompass the whole culture
- silent listener in analysis

The efficacy of psychoanalysis is debatable

- civilization is hostile to people and their desires
