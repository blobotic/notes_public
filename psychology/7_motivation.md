# Motivational Concepts

**motivation** - a need or desire that energizes and directs behavior

## Instinct Theory

**instinct** - a complex behavior that is rigidly patterned throughout a species and is unlearned
- ex. imprinting, salmon returning to birthplace, babies sucking, etc

Instinct theory views our instincts as the source of our motivation
- Charles Darwin's influence

## Drive-Reduction Theory

**physiological need** - a basic bodily requirement
- ex. food or water
- drives: ex. hunger or thirst

**drive reduction theory** - the idea that a physiological need creates an aroused state (a drive) that motivates an organism to satisfy the need
- how our bodies strive for **homeostasis**, the tendency to maintain a balanced or constant internal state (the regulation of any aspect of body chemistry, such as blood glucose, around a particular level)

**incentive** - a positive or negative environmental stimulus that motivates behavior
- we are pulled by incentives
- when there is both a need and an incentive, we feel strongly driven

extrinsic vs intrinsic rewards

## Arousal Theory

**Yerkes-Dodson law** - the principle that performance increases with arousal only up to a point, beyond which performance decreases
- moderate anxiety can be motivating, but there can exist too much stimulation or stress
- moderate arousal leads to optimal performance

## Maslow's Hierarchy of Needs

**hierarchy of needs** - Maslow's pyramid of human needs, beginning at the base with physiological needs that must be first satisfied before higher-level safety needs and then psychological needs become active

| title | content |
| -- | -- |
| Self-transcendence needs | Need to find meaning and identity beyond the self |
| Self-actualization needs | Need to live up to our fullest and unique potential |
| Esteem needs | Need for self-esteem, achievement, competence, and independence; need for recognition and respect from others |
| Belongingness and love needs | Need to love and be loved, to belong and be accepted; need to avoid loneliness and separation |
| Safety needs | Need to feel that the world is organized and predictable; need to feel safe |
| Physiological needs | Need to satisfy hunger and thirst |

*self-transcendence* - people strive for meaning, purpose, and communion in a way that is transpersonal, beyond the self

the order is not universally fixed, and culture influences our priorities
